One reason is that you decide on the aperture and allow you camera to decide on the shutter speed, considering metering mode.</p><h5 id="Step2-Metering-Mode"><a href="#Step2-Metering-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Metering Mode"></a>Step2 Metering Mode</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-7.jpg"                      alt="metering modes of camera"                ></p><p>You’ll need to decide between the evaluative&#x2F;matrix (scene-based), center wieghted or spot metering modes. Choosing one entirely based on your preferences.</p><p>However, evaluative&#x2F;scene-based metering mode is seen as the reliable mode in aperture priority. Because, this mode will balance and find median exposure on the given scene.</p><h5 id="Step3-Aperture-ISO-and-Shutter"><a href="#Step3-Aperture-ISO-and-Shutter" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Aperture, ISO and Shutter"></a>Step3 Aperture, ISO and Shutter</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-8.jpg"                      alt="iso"                ></p><p>For landscape or cityscape, an ISO of 100 is considered the best. Even in low light situation, this setting works.</p><p>A small aperture of about f&#x2F;8 to f&#x2F;22 is enough. However, you need to check the level of lens sharpness to get balanced photos.</p><p>Shutter speed translates to the estimated time the sensor exposes to the scene, the longer the shutter speed, the brighter your photo will be.</p><p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong></p><p>Go for raw shooting, as raw files keep record information on the given image sensor.</p><h5 id="Step4-Automatic-Exposure-Bracketing"><a href="#Step4-Automatic-Exposure-Bracketing" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Automatic Exposure Bracketing"></a>Step4 Automatic Exposure Bracketing</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-9.jpg"                      alt="aeb setting"                ></p><p>If you’re using a DSLR&#x2F;mirrorless camera, it’ll have AEB. To enable it, go to menu. You should go through the manual, as every camera has accessed the feature differently.</p><p>Once found, it’ll make you set two things; interval and bracket. Brackets will decide on the number of photos you’ll capture whereas interval keeps the gap between those photos.</p><h5 id="Step5-Timer-and-Mirror"><a href="#Step5-Timer-and-Mirror" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Timer and Mirror"></a>Step5 Timer and Mirror</h5><p>You can focus on these steps to reduce slightest movement, even if your camera is mounted on the tripod.</p><p><strong>Timer</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-10.jpg"                      alt="timer"                ></p><p>A two-second timer sounds great as it’ll prevent you from coming in contact with your gear and avoid even the least chance of movement.</p><p><strong>Mirror Lockup</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-11.jpg"                      alt="mirror lockup"                ></p><p>A risk of micro-vibration is present in DSLRs, especially when the mirror flips up and expose the image sensor to the light.

At the core of these devices there are some major improvements between the Phantom 3 Pro and the Phantom 4. DJI beefed up the frame as a starting point for the Phantom 4. Making the device far more resilient as well as including a larger battery.</p><p> 2. Making the drone heavier by 100g has not compromised performance whatsoever. In fact it has improved the performance of the entire drone exponentially.</p><p> 3. The Phantom 4 can now reach speeds of 4 meters per second faster than the previous version of the drone. It can also detect obstacles between 2 and 49 feet for the prevention of accidents as well as extend flight time by at least 5 min. on the Phantom 3.</p><p> 4. Still images have not been improved greatly in their quality but the DJI Phantom 4 now has an onboard camera that’s capable of UHD 4k video as well as a number of other formats. The older version of the drone featured a different sensor and different image processing which did not allow for the same quality of video.</p><h2 id="Complete-comparison-and-review"><a href="#Complete-comparison-and-review" class="headerlink" title="Complete comparison and review"></a>Complete comparison and review</h2><h4 id="1-Design"><a href="#1-Design" class="headerlink" title="1.  Design"></a>1.  Design</h4><p> The design of the DJI Phantom 4 has changed lightly on the Phantom 3. The stripes have been taken off of the side and the finish is greatly improved with a refined grey plastic underneath to hide a number of the exposed elements that could be seen on the Phantom 3. The branding is also available on the front which makes the drone seem a lot more professional. The finish allows for customization on the DJI Phantom 4 and this means that many professionals could include their logo or customize the drone as they may want for advertising. Overall the design of the Phantom 4 is much more aesthetically pleasing and a definite improvement when compared to the Phantom 3 pro.</p><h4 id="2-Battery-life"><a href="#2-Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="2.  Battery life"></a>2.  Battery life</h4><p> The battery life performance of the Phantom 4 is improved considerably. DJI was able to include a 5350mAH liPo battery which is extended the flight time by 5 minutes or more. The device also charges in a relatively quick amount of time with batteries that can be hot swapped out. Getting several batteries for the Phantom 4 can make it easy to complete an entire shoot or have 30-40 minutes of flight time as a constant.</p><h4 id="3-Obstacle-avoidance"><a href="#3-Obstacle-avoidance" class="headerlink" title="3.  Obstacle avoidance"></a>3.  Obstacle avoidance</h4><p> The obstacle avoidance has been upgraded on the Phantom 4 vs the Phantom 3 and this allows for object detection up to 49 feet away from the drone. This can be a very powerful tool especially for preventing accidents and using a number of the automated flying features. These types of improvements have made this drone much more user-friendly especially for beginner drone pilots.</p><h4 id="4-Tracking"><a href="#4-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="4.  Tracking"></a>4.  Tracking</h4><p> With improved jet detection, the Phantom 4 can deliver a better subject tracking service as well as active track. The newest version of active track comes with the DJI GO app and it involves turning on moving POI and then highlighting a circle around the subject that you would like to follow and track. There’s no need to create a beacon or wear a band and it can be quite intelligent.</p><h4 id="5-Camera"><a href="#5-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5.  Camera"></a>5.  Camera</h4><p> The Camera in the DJI Phantom 4 has massively improved the quality of video especially. Although there isn’t much difference in the format for still photos, the onboard image processing of the 4k camera allows for deeper and richer colors as well as an improved frame rate for UHD video. The newest onboard camera uses a 12.4 megapixel still image camera with image processing capable of handling 4K UHD video at 25fps. Max image sizes available are 4000 x 3000 and the field of view and focus is improved with a new lens configuration.</p><h4 id="6-Speed-and-agility"><a href="#6-Speed-and-agility" class="headerlink" title="6.  Speed and agility"></a>6.  Speed and agility</h4><p> The speed was improved with the help of the newer frame from the DJI Phantom 4. The device is capable of reaching speeds 4 m&#x2F;s faster than on the Phantom 3. It also feels much more polished to fly and with the collision avoidance and other features, the drone can keep up during action shots better as well as maintain a more stable flight with the extra power and weight ratio.</p><h4 id="7-Conclusion"><a href="#7-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="7.  Conclusion"></a>7.  Conclusion</h4><p> Although after reading this article you may be quick to suggest that the DJI Phantom 4 is hands-down the best drone, this may not be the case for your budget. Overall, if you are planning on using a drone for surveying or still images, either one will serve you well. Of course the Phantom 4 does have some improvements over the Phantom 3 but with the difference in price the Phantom 3 could still likely serve you well as a drone for capturing video and great flight performance. If you need the best, the Phantom 4 is a good choice but if you just need a consistent drone capable of filling a consumer or professional need, the Phantom 3 will still satisfy the same needs. It is tough to call but the Phantom 3 for its value is still likely the best pick until a new version of the DJI Phantom is released!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-1"><a href="#Max-Wales-1" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> The name Phantom and DJI are synonymous with quality in the world of drones but with several different versions of the DJI Phantom drone available it’s worth it to know the differences between them.

Design"></a>1.  Design</h4><p> The design of the DJI Phantom 4 has changed lightly on the Phantom 3. The stripes have been taken off of the side and the finish is greatly improved with a refined grey plastic underneath to hide a number of the exposed elements that could be seen on the Phantom 3. The branding is also available on the front which makes the drone seem a lot more professional. The finish allows for customization on the DJI Phantom 4 and this means that many professionals could include their logo or customize the drone as they may want for advertising.

Battery life"></a>2.  Battery life</h4><p> The battery life performance of the Phantom 4 is improved considerably. DJI was able to include a 5350mAH liPo battery which is extended the flight time by 5 minutes or more. The device also charges in a relatively quick amount of time with batteries that can be hot swapped out. Getting several batteries for the Phantom 4 can make it easy to complete an entire shoot or have 30-40 minutes of flight time as a constant.</p><h4 id="3-Obstacle-avoidance-2"><a href="#3-Obstacle-avoidance-2" class="headerlink" title="3.  Obstacle avoidance"></a>3.  Obstacle avoidance</h4><p> The obstacle avoidance has been upgraded on the Phantom 4 vs the Phantom 3 and this allows for object detection up to 49 feet away from the drone. This can be a very powerful tool especially for preventing accidents and using a number of the automated flying features. These types of improvements have made this drone much more user-friendly especially for beginner drone pilots.</p><h4 id="4-Tracking-2"><a href="#4-Tracking-2" class="headerlink" title="4.  Tracking"></a>4.  Tracking</h4><p> With improved jet detection, the Phantom 4 can deliver a better subject tracking service as well as active track. The newest version of active track comes with the DJI GO app and it involves turning on moving POI and then highlighting a circle around the subject that you would like to follow and track. There’s no need to create a beacon or wear a band and it can be quite intelligent.</p><h4 id="5-Camera-2"><a href="#5-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="5.  Camera"></a>5.  Camera</h4><p> The Camera in the DJI Phantom 4 has massively improved the quality of video especially. Although there isn’t much difference in the format for still photos, the onboard image processing of the 4k camera allows for deeper and richer colors as well as an improved frame rate for UHD video. The newest onboard camera uses a 12.4 megapixel still image camera with image processing capable of handling 4K UHD video at 25fps. Max image sizes available are 4000 x 3000 and the field of view and focus is improved with a new lens configuration.</p><h4 id="6-Speed-and-agility-2"><a href="#6-Speed-and-agility-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

The device is capable of reaching speeds 4 m&#x2F;s faster than on the Phantom 3. It also feels much more polished to fly and with the collision avoidance and other features, the drone can keep up during action shots better as well as maintain a more stable flight with the extra power and weight ratio.</p><h4 id="7-Conclusion-2"><a href="#7-Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

Overall, if you are planning on using a drone for surveying or still images, either one will serve you well. Of course the Phantom 4 does have some improvements over the Phantom 3 but with the difference in price the Phantom 3 could still likely serve you well as a drone for capturing video and great flight performance. If you need the best, the Phantom 4 is a good choice but if you just need a consistent drone capable of filling a consumer or professional need, the Phantom 3 will still satisfy the same needs. It is tough to call but the Phantom 3 for its value is still likely the best pick until a new version of the DJI Phantom is released!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-3"><a href="#Max-Wales-3" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> The name Phantom and DJI are synonymous with quality in the world of drones but with several different versions of the DJI Phantom drone available it’s worth it to know the differences between them.

It sets the tone of the entire presentation and helps create a lasting impact on audiences. Not giving any priority to music can be a common mistake for marketers who naturally place more importance on content. Sometimes, these mistakes can cause time constraints and even cost money. Here’s how you can find the right <strong>paid and free trailer music</strong> for your ventures.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/trailer-music-1.jpg"                      alt="trailer music"                ></p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">SoundCloud</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">ccMixter</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Free Music Archive</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">FreePD</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Uppbeat</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to add music to your trailer</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-choose-the-background-music-for-the-trailer"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-choose-the-background-music-for-the-trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to choose the background music for the trailer?</h2><h3 id="Establish-A-Clear-Schedule"><a href="#Establish-A-Clear-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="Establish A Clear Schedule"></a><strong>Establish A Clear Schedule</strong></h3><p>While music may appear to be a minimal point in your trailer, it can be more impactful than you think. Tone and effects aside, music is highly associated with perception and observation. This means that things like up and down and lilts in the sound can affect different kinds of emotions in your video.</p><p>Because of that, you must time your video content according to those factors. Maximize the emotional impact in your videos by perfectly timing your content and matching the music’s pace. Pick your music early on in the project and match your content accordingly to avoid time and budget constraints.</p><h3 id="Consider-the-Setting"><a href="#Consider-the-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Consider the Setting"></a><strong>Consider the Setting</strong></h3><p>When presenting the story, you want to tell in your film, the feelings and meanings expressed in your music are an important consideration. Make sure what you intend to communicate to your audience is clear. Do you like to teach people or perhaps share a particular tale with them? Is the tone light-hearted, sad, or grave? Consider these goals and use them as a guide while selecting the music.</p><p>It is recommended to avoid relying on simple tags like “trailer music” or “trailer background songs”, as these usually show generic results that do not factor in tone and setting. Think outside the box instead and search for music that you associate with your story. Take advantage of tags and keywords to find a song that works best for you.</p><h3 id="Test-With-Watermarked-Tracks"><a href="#Test-With-Watermarked-Tracks" class="headerlink" title="Test With Watermarked Tracks"></a><strong>Test With Watermarked Tracks</strong></h3><p>Many websites may require you to pay for tracks before you can test them out in your video. That means spending on several music files that you may not even get to use soon.</p><p>Luckily, some websites let users download free vocal-watermarked versions of their music. With these tracks, you can test the files on your video editor so you can check for tone and timing without spending unnecessarily.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Free-Websites-for-Downloading-Trailer-Music"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Free-Websites-for-Downloading-Trailer-Music" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Best Free Websites for Downloading Trailer Music</h2><p>Licensed and mainstream media music can be costly and inaccessible to many, which is why it is common to opt for public domain music or creative commons music. This music is completely free to use and comes from legal sources.</p><p>It is important to note that some creative commons music may require certain actions like attribution or giving credit to creators. Some files prohibit modifications in the material. If you are interested in the perks of free music, make sure to read up on different kinds of licenses to avoid legal sanctions.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the best sources of free music files for your trailer:</p><h3 id="1-SoundCloud"><a href="#1-SoundCloud" class="headerlink" title="1.

How to choose the background music for the trailer?</p><h3 id="Establish-A-Clear-Schedule-1"><a href="#Establish-A-Clear-Schedule-1" class="headerlink" title="Establish A Clear Schedule"></a><strong>Establish A Clear Schedule</strong></h3><p>While music may appear to be a minimal point in your trailer, it can be more impactful than you think. Tone and effects aside, music is highly associated with perception and observation. This means that things like up and down and lilts in the sound can affect different kinds of emotions in your video.</p><p>Because of that, you must time your video content according to those factors. Maximize the emotional impact in your videos by perfectly timing your content and matching the music’s pace. Pick your music early on in the project and match your content accordingly to avoid time and budget constraints.</p><h3 id="Consider-the-Setting-1"><a href="#Consider-the-Setting-1" class="headerlink" title="Consider the Setting"></a><strong>Consider the Setting</strong></h3><p>When presenting the story, you want to tell in your film, the feelings and meanings expressed in your music are an important consideration. Make sure what you intend to communicate to your audience is clear. Do you like to teach people or perhaps share a particular tale with them? Is the tone light-hearted, sad, or grave? Consider these goals and use them as a guide while selecting the music.</p><p>It is recommended to avoid relying on simple tags like “trailer music” or “trailer background songs”, as these usually show generic results that do not factor in tone and setting. Think outside the box instead and search for music that you associate with your story. Take advantage of tags and keywords to find a song that works best for you.</p><h3 id="Test-With-Watermarked-Tracks-1"><a href="#Test-With-Watermarked-Tracks-1" class="headerlink" title="Test With Watermarked Tracks"></a><strong>Test With Watermarked Tracks</strong></h3><p>Many websites may require you to pay for tracks before you can test them out in your video. That means spending on several music files that you may not even get to use soon.</p><p>Luckily, some websites let users download free vocal-watermarked versions of their music. With these tracks, you can test the files on your video editor so you can check for tone and timing without spending unnecessarily.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Free-Websites-for-Downloading-Trailer-Music-1"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Free-Websites-for-Downloading-Trailer-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Best Free Websites for Downloading Trailer Music"></a>Part 2. Best Free Websites for Downloading Trailer Music</h2><p>Licensed and mainstream media music can be costly and inaccessible to many, which is why it is common to opt for public domain music or creative commons music. This music is completely free to use and comes from legal sources.</p><p>It is important to note that some creative commons music may require certain actions like attribution or giving credit to creators. Some files prohibit modifications in the material. If you are interested in the perks of free music, make sure to read up on different kinds of licenses to avoid legal sanctions.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the best sources of free music files for your trailer:</p><h3 id="1-SoundCloud-1"><a href="#1-SoundCloud-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><h2 id="1-60-fps"><a href="#1-60-fps" class="headerlink" title="1. 60 fps"></a>1. 60 fps</h2><p>Anything higher than 30 fps is for creating slow-motion videos. 60 fps is the standard slow motion frame rate for Hollywood movies. You must have come across scenes where the superhero walks out slowly in a dramatic manner. Such scenes are shot at 60fps and displayed at 24 or 30 fps. Besides, this frame rate is suitable for capturing character’s emotions as well.</p><p>Basically, you should use 60 fps when the action is already slow. Some examples are someone walking out of an action sequence, blowing off candles, or getting dressed. Shooting video at 60fps enhances the smoothness of the action. The visuals look more detailed and real. That is why people shoot 4K videos at 60fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for any action that is already slow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="60 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-120-fps"><a href="#2-120-fps" class="headerlink" title="2. 120 fps"></a>2. 120 fps</h2><p>Let us assume that you are shooting at 120 fps and displaying at 30 fps. The video will play 4 times slower than it is in real life. The slow-motion effect will be two times slower than shooting at 60fps. If you shoot slow action at 120 fps, the output will be unusually slow and visually unpleasant. Therefore, you should shoot fast action scenes at 120 fps.</p><p>Some of the examples are someone running, playing slow sports, or drifting a car. You will find professionals using 120 fps for showing the slow-motion football kick and baseball bat swing. The scene will come out super smooth and visually crisp. 120 fps is widely used in the gaming industry for fast-paced action games.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast-paced action and fast moving subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/120-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="120 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="3-180-fps"><a href="#3-180-fps" class="headerlink" title="3. 180 fps"></a>3. 180 fps</h2><p>The scenes that are suitable for 120 fps are also suitable for 180 fps. This means you can shoot fast-moving subjects, objects, and elements. Some of the examples are horse riding, subject running, riding a bike, and likewise. But when you shoot at 180 fps, your objective is to show down the action much further.</p><p>This means that a scene shot at 180 fps will look slower than at 120 fps. You must have seen scenes where an object in motion is slowed down and zoomed in for detail. Such scenes are perfect for 180 frame rate. You may not achieve super slow mow scenes but it is going to be somewhere near that.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast moving action with emphasis on slow downing motion further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/180-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="180 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="4-240-fps"><a href="#4-240-fps" class="headerlink" title="4. 240 fps"></a>4. 240 fps</h2><p>When you are capturing an action that is too fast for your eyes to see, you should use 240 fps. For example, when you are watching a fast-paced sports event, your eyes cannot capture all movements. When you capture those scenes at 240 fps, the output video will look more comfortable for the eyes. The use of 240 fps is very popular in sports like cricket.</p><p>The broadcasters show replays in slow motion by capturing bat and ball strikes at 240 fps. You will also come across videos like slow mow water splashes that are shot at 240 fps. In action movies, you can see the hero punching the villain in the face. Then the scene shows the impact of the punch on the face with skin and muscle getting shattered. Such scenes are perfectly shot at 240 fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for action that are too fast for the eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/240-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="240 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="5-480-fps"><a href="#5-480-fps" class="headerlink" title="5. 480 fps"></a>5. 480 fps</h2><p>If you want super slow motion video, you have to shoot at 480 fps. The 480 frame rate is considered to be the base of super slow motion. There are higher frame rates available for more enhanced super slow-motion videos. When you shoot at 480 fps, the video will play 16 times slower. This is usual in showcasing extremely fast movements.</p><p>For example, when you are shooting with a gun, the bullet goes out at lightning speed. You will need 480 fps to capture the scene of the bullet coming out of the gun and show it in extremely slow motion. Some other scenarios are slicing a vegetable with a knife, dropping a water-filled balloon on the floor, or performing skateboard skills. All such scenarios should be shot at 480 fps for super slow video output.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting extremely fast actions and show in super slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/480-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="480 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no definite answer to which is the best frame rate for slow motion.

Different frame rates are suitable for different scenes. The faster the action you are shooting, the higher should be the frame rate.

That is why people shoot 4K videos at 60fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for any action that is already slow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="60 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-120-fps-2"><a href="#2-120-fps-2" class="headerlink" title="2. 120 fps"></a>2. 120 fps</h2><p>Let us assume that you are shooting at 120 fps and displaying at 30 fps. The video will play 4 times slower than it is in real life. The slow-motion effect will be two times slower than shooting at 60fps. If you shoot slow action at 120 fps, the output will be unusually slow and visually unpleasant. Therefore, you should shoot fast action scenes at 120 fps.</p><p>Some of the examples are someone running, playing slow sports, or drifting a car. You will find professionals using 120 fps for showing the slow-motion football kick and baseball bat swing. The scene will come out super smooth and visually crisp. 120 fps is widely used in the gaming industry for fast-paced action games.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast-paced action and fast moving subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/120-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="120 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="3-180-fps-2"><a href="#3-180-fps-2" class="headerlink" title="3. 180 fps"></a>3. 180 fps</h2><p>The scenes that are suitable for 120 fps are also suitable for 180 fps. This means you can shoot fast-moving subjects, objects, and elements. Some of the examples are horse riding, subject running, riding a bike, and likewise. But when you shoot at 180 fps, your objective is to show down the action much further.</p><p>This means that a scene shot at 180 fps will look slower than at 120 fps. You must have seen scenes where an object in motion is slowed down and zoomed in for detail. Such scenes are perfect for 180 frame rate. You may not achieve super slow mow scenes but it is going to be somewhere near that.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast moving action with emphasis on slow downing motion further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/180-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="180 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="4-240-fps-2"><a href="#4-240-fps-2" class="headerlink" title="4. 240 fps"></a>4. 240 fps</h2><p>When you are capturing an action that is too fast for your eyes to see, you should use 240 fps. For example, when you are watching a fast-paced sports event, your eyes cannot capture all movements. When you capture those scenes at 240 fps, the output video will look more comfortable for the eyes. The use of 240 fps is very popular in sports like cricket.</p><p>The broadcasters show replays in slow motion by capturing bat and ball strikes at 240 fps. You will also come across videos like slow mow water splashes that are shot at 240 fps. In action movies, you can see the hero punching the villain in the face. Then the scene shows the impact of the punch on the face with skin and muscle getting shattered. Such scenes are perfectly shot at 240 fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for action that are too fast for the eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/240-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="240 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="5-480-fps-2"><a href="#5-480-fps-2" class="headerlink" title="5. 480 fps"></a>5. 480 fps</h2><p>If you want super slow motion video, you have to shoot at 480 fps. The 480 frame rate is considered to be the base of super slow motion. There are higher frame rates available for more enhanced super slow-motion videos. When you shoot at 480 fps, the video will play 16 times slower. This is usual in showcasing extremely fast movements.</p><p>For example, when you are shooting with a gun, the bullet goes out at lightning speed. You will need 480 fps to capture the scene of the bullet coming out of the gun and show it in extremely slow motion. Some other scenarios are slicing a vegetable with a knife, dropping a water-filled balloon on the floor, or performing skateboard skills. All such scenarios should be shot at 480 fps for super slow video output.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting extremely fast actions and show in super slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/480-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="480 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no definite answer to which is the best frame rate for slow motion. It completely depends on what you are shooting. Yes, it is true that 60 fps is the standard slow motion fps. But 60 fps is only suitable when the action is low as well. Different frame rates are suitable for different scenes. The faster the action you are shooting, the higher should be the frame rate. For smooth super slow motion video, you should consider shooting at 480 fps. Frame rate beyond 480 is suitable for capturing slow-motion explosion videos.</p><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography. Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><h2 id="1-60-fps-3"><a href="#1-60-fps-3" class="headerlink" title="1. 60 fps"></a>1. 60 fps</h2><p>Anything higher than 30 fps is for creating slow-motion videos. 60 fps is the standard slow motion frame rate for Hollywood movies. You must have come across scenes where the superhero walks out slowly in a dramatic manner. Such scenes are shot at 60fps and displayed at 24 or 30 fps. Besides, this frame rate is suitable for capturing character’s emotions as well.</p><p>Basically, you should use 60 fps when the action is already slow. Some examples are someone walking out of an action sequence, blowing off candles, or getting dressed. Shooting video at 60fps enhances the smoothness of the action.

While some models of the para drones can retail for $500-$1000 depending on the accessories you want to use with them, the Parrot AR drone 2.0 Elite Edition is one of the most affordable full-size drones available on the market currently. At a price point of under $300 for the standard version and under $370 for the version with two batteries, The Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite Edition sits on the line between a great toy drone and a borderline professional drone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-ar-drone-elite.jpg"                      alt="parrot ar drone elite"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNWLO14/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01JNWLO14&linkId=75a457e4caf0a07b5d6a970a0cc00258" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The parrot AR drone 2.0 is mostly created using plastic as well as a Styrofoam body. The drone can take videos without sound as well as quality still photos.

It also doesn’t fly particularly well in poor weather.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life-3"><a href="#3-Battery-Life-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery Life"></a>3.  Battery Life</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is considerably shorter than many of the other drones available in its size. The main problem that you can face when piloting this drone is its 5 to 10 min. flight time. If you have settings on the drone to safely land when it reaches near the end of its battery life, you can expect of flight time of just 6 min. on average. This flight time is remedied by purchasing the extended battery from Parrot for an additional $50. This can often extend flight time to at least 10 to 15 min. with a maximum flight time of 18 min..</p><h4 id="4-Performance-in-Flight-3"><a href="#4-Performance-in-Flight-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  Performance in Flight"></a>4.  Performance in Flight</h4><p> The takeoff and landing settings can really ease the process of learning how to fly this drone. The app is extremely responsive and the lightweight nature of the drawn makes it very maneuverable while it is in flight. This drone has become a favorite toy in the community to learn how to perform flips and other air trips. With a recommended flight height of within 50 ft this drone can climb fast and perform quite well in fairly calm conditions.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range-3"><a href="#5-Control-Range-3" class="headerlink" title="5.  Control Range"></a>5.  Control Range</h4><p> The control Range on this drone is relatively low as it is operated via Wi-Fi hotspot. In most cases the drone can be controlled within 35 yards but the signal can get week outside of this zone. Making sure to keep the drone relatively close will make sure that safety protocols are not turned on for an automatic landing or so that the drone does not crash.</p><h4 id="6-Camera-quality-3"><a href="#6-Camera-quality-3" class="headerlink" title="6.  Camera quality"></a>6.  Camera quality</h4><p> The camera quality on this drone is capable of producing a 720P picture. It doesn’t come with an additional mount so your camera quality is quite restricted. The image quality from the drone is fair but definitely not something that you would want to use for ongoing filming or still capture in the air.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-luts-techniques-for-movie-visuals-enhancement/"><u>[New] Luts Techniques for Movie Visuals Enhancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-pushing-limits-with-4k-vision-lgs-monitor-the-31mu97-b/"><u>[New] Pushing Limits with 4K Vision – LG's Monitor, the 31MU97-B</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-pioneering-path-for-instantaneous-srt-to-text-conversions/"><u>[New] Pioneering Path for Instantaneous SRT to Text Conversions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-secret-tips-for-stunning-sketches-and-scans/"><u>2024 Approved  Secret Tips for Stunning Sketches & Scans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-instant-time-stamping-techniques-for-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] Instant Time-Stamping Techniques for YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-pioneering-techniques-in-the-world-of-gif-animation/"><u>In 2024, Pioneering Techniques in the World of GIF Animation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-nextgen-editing-best-4k-displays-to-watch/"><u>2024 Approved  NextGen Editing  Best 4K Displays to Watch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-premium-selection-of-free-4k-software-for-windows-plus-os-x/"><u>[New] Premium Selection of Free 4K Software for Windows + OS X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ringtone-revelry-top-choices-for-laugh-inducing-calls/"><u>2024 Approved  Ringtone Revelry  Top Choices for Laugh-Inducing Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quickstream-simple-steps-for-live-podcast-broadcasting/"><u>2024 Approved  Quickstream  Simple Steps for Live Podcast Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/sharpen-zoom-conversations-eliminate-distortion-for-2024/"><u>Sharpen Zoom Conversations  Eliminate Distortion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-mastering-4k-with-prime-lenses-for-professionals/"><u>[New] Mastering 4K with Prime Lenses for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-personal-drones-that-perfectly-trace-their-owners-path/"><u>2024 Approved  Personal Drones That Perfectly Trace Their Owner's Path</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ranked-your-must-have-5-iphones-for-excellent-podcasting/"><u>2024 Approved  Ranked  Your Must-Have 5 iPhones for Excellent Podcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-shutter-stillness-strategies-for-photos/"><u>[New] Shutter Stillness Strategies for Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/optimizing-playback-speed-with-professional-tactics-for-2024/"><u>Optimizing Playback Speed with Professional Tactics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/starting-with-simple-tricks-auditions-fade-techniques-for-2024/"><u>Starting with Simple Tricks  Audition's Fade Techniques for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons" class="headerlink" title="2. Wikimedia Commons"></a>2. Wikimedia Commons</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-2.jpg"                      alt="wikimedia commons"                ></p><p>Wikimedia Commons is arguably the largest public domain image library available. It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons" class="headerlink" title="4.

Flickr Commons</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr commons"                ></p><p>Initially, Flickr only featured images from a selection of verified contributors. However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date. Alternatively, you can find public domain content by visiting the Public Domain group URL.</p><h2 id="Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine"><a href="#Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine"></a>Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</h2><p>Although Google search is the most popular resource for royalty-free art, there are specific public domain art search engines to help you find exactly what you need. Here are a few of them to consider.</p><h3 id="1-Artvee-com"><a href="#1-Artvee-com" class="headerlink" title="1. Artvee.com"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://artvee.com/" >Artvee.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-5.jpg"                      alt="artvee com"                ></p><p>Artvee.com is a public domain art search engine that specializes in classical art. The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo"><a href="#2-Museo" class="headerlink" title="2. Museo"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://museo.app/" >Museo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-6.jpg"                      alt="museo"                ></p><p>Another public domain art search engine to consider is Museo.app. It is an open-source web interface that allows you to find royalty-free art from different museums. Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes. Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it.

This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free-1"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures-1"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Public Domain Pictures"></a>1. Public Domain Pictures</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-1.jpg"                      alt="public domain pictures"                ></p><p>Publicdomainpictures.net is a collection of thousands of photos and videos across all genres. In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons-1"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Wikimedia Commons"></a>2. Wikimedia Commons</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-2.jpg"                      alt="wikimedia commons"                ></p><p>Wikimedia Commons is arguably the largest public domain image library available. It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The New York Public Library Digital Collections"></a>3.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons-1"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Flickr Commons"></a>4. Flickr Commons</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr commons"                ></p><p>Initially, Flickr only featured images from a selection of verified contributors. However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date. Alternatively, you can find public domain content by visiting the Public Domain group URL.</p><h2 id="Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine-1"><a href="#Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine-1" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine"></a>Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</h2><p>Although Google search is the most popular resource for royalty-free art, there are specific public domain art search engines to help you find exactly what you need. Here are a few of them to consider.</p><h3 id="1-Artvee-com-1"><a href="#1-Artvee-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Artvee.com"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://artvee.com/" >Artvee.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-5.jpg"                      alt="artvee com"                ></p><p>Artvee.com is a public domain art search engine that specializes in classical art. The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo-1"><a href="#2-Museo-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Museo"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://museo.app/" >Museo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-6.jpg"                      alt="museo"                ></p><p>Another public domain art search engine to consider is Museo.app. It is an open-source web interface that allows you to find royalty-free art from different museums. Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><h2 id="FAQ-1"><a href="#FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes. Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it. Furthermore, it does not include any usage restrictions.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular

And then, online programs could become very useful to overlay and merge images in a desktop version, without you having to download anything.

Moreover, this website does not put any limit on the number of images or photos to be superimposed, even if the only way to do it is to overlap them one at a time, and not altogether. In practice, Online Image Editor works literally in layers, with the next image that overlaps with the previous one, and so on. To underline the fact that the images should not necessarily be superimposed, but also juxtaposed to one another on the same background, or rotated, or with various background effects such as shadows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-1.jpg"                      alt="online image editor"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>The user interface is simple and friendly with numerous editing features</li><li>Images can be crafted in an excellent manner</li><li>Optimum and consistent performance is assured</li><li>Fotor offers a one-tap enhancement tool that spontaneously touches up normal images</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Many distractive ads keep showing up</li><li>Special image editing background is required</li><li>Effects cannot be tweaked with Fotor</li><li>The font sizes cannot be changed in an independent manner</li><li>In the free version, many features and functionalities have been disabled</li></ul><h3 id="2-LunaPic"><a href="#2-LunaPic" class="headerlink" title="2.

People like me who work as freelancers or in different companies now use Zoom for numerous work calls and daily virtual meets. It doesn’t matter if you have a laptop or a smartphone you can put Zoom to use anytime.</p><p>So if you have a query, “is Zoom in android actually a thing?” and if you are new to Zoom, don’t know how to start or join a Zoom meeting on Android, and how to schedule it, this step-wise process will help you out. So before making that Zoom call, here is everything you must understand and be aware of:</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Join Zoom meetings using a Zoom ID on Android</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Schedule a Zoom Meeting Android</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here’s how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:</p><ul><li>On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option “<strong>New Meeting.</strong>“</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg"                      alt="new zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for the selection of “<strong>Start a Meeting.</strong>“ Once done, you will notice a video conference space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg"                      alt="start a zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, you will see a pop-up with the “<strong>Got it</strong>“ button on it.

Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom’s contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on. So it’s pretty simple to use in that sense.</li><li>Now, you have to press “<strong>Send Email</strong>“ by putting everyone’s email address and now, click on the “<strong>Send</strong>“ button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-5.jpg"                      alt="send email zoom meeting"                ></p><p>Also, when it comes to copying the meeting’s hyperlink, you can opt to tap on the “<strong>Copy invite link</strong>“ option on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Start a Zoom Meeting on Android</p><p>There is no doubt that the Zoom app on an android device is easy to navigate through and put to use. All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here’s how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:</p><ul><li>On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option “<strong>New Meeting.</strong>“</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg"                      alt="new zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for the selection of “<strong>Start a Meeting.</strong>“ Once done, you will notice a video conference space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg"                      alt="start a zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, you will see a pop-up with the “<strong>Got it</strong>“ button on it.

Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom’s contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on.

These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view"><a href="#1-Field-of-view" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality"><a href="#2-Picture-quality" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software"><a href="#3-Companion-software" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is? That the downloading is free of cost.</p><h2 id="The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022"><a href="#The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022"></a>The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022</h2><p>Each year, the technology people use to listen to podcasts continues to improve.

There are many different types of web cameras available, so choose carefully.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>What is a webcam recording?</p><p>A webcam is a small, easy-to-use camera plugged into your computer to allow you to see yourself in real time. These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting-1"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting-1" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view-1"><a href="#1-Field-of-view-1" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality-1"><a href="#2-Picture-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software-1"><a href="#3-Companion-software-1" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is? That the downloading is free of cost.</p><h2 id="The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022-1"><a href="#The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022-1" class="headerlink" title="The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022"></a>The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022</h2><p>Each year, the technology people use to listen to podcasts continues to improve.

Some requires paid version as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/videoshow-app-review-1.jpg"                      alt="special effects"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-VideoShow-Video-Editor-App-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-VideoShow-Video-Editor-App-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to use VideoShow Video Editor App?</h2><p>Now that we know about it, we will discuss how we can use it.</p><h3 id="Import-1"><a href="#Import-1" class="headerlink" title="Import"></a>Import</h3><p>First, click on the video edit button to import your media files to the VideoShow video editor. Then it will take you to a menu where all your mobile’s media will appear. You can select the media you want to import and click on the add button. The flaws in its importing are that it cannot separate your media in such a way that your pictures and videos are in different sections. However, thankfully there are separations of albums in it, making it easy for you to find the media you want. Also, in the free version, you cannot import any video of higher resolution. You need to convert them to some lower resolution for it.</p><h3 id="Filters-1"><a href="#Filters-1" class="headerlink" title="Filters"></a>Filters</h3><p>You can use filters by clicking on the filters option, which will be at the bottom of your screen. Then it will take you to its filter library, where you can choose the filter of your choice. And then, click on the Tick button to apply that filter to your video. Some filters are free, and for some, you must purchase their premium package.</p><h3 id="Stickers-1"><a href="#Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="Stickers"></a>Stickers</h3><p>You can add different stickers to your video using it as well. For this purpose, you have to select the sticker’s option from the bottom menu of it. A library will open from which you can choose them. After choosing your favorite stickers, click the Apply the changes button at the top right corner.</p><h3 id="Speed-adjustment-1"><a href="#Speed-adjustment-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed adjustment"></a>Speed adjustment</h3><p>Its speed adjustment feature is also not less than any of the above, as it can help you to make your video slow or fast. It will surely provide you with a cinematic effect. To use this feature, you must click the Edit button. Then you have to click on the Clip edit option and then the speed option. A setting will appear from which you can easily adjust your video’s speed. It is a free feature. It does not require any premium package from you.</p><h3 id="Export-1"><a href="#Export-1" class="headerlink" title="Export"></a>Export</h3><p>Now you click on the export button at the top right of your screen for this. After that, a menu asks which resolution you want to export your content. Only those who use a free version of the software can export videos at SD resolution.

The so-called Bokeh effect adds depth to the photo and it also allows the photographer to separate the model in the foreground from the background. Furthermore, creating a portrait photo with Apple’s smartphones has never been easier, because the latest models of iPhones that have a twin-lens system make this process fun and easy.</p><p>In this article, we are going to show you how to take photos in Portrait Mode, on iPhone X, 8 Plus, and 7 Plus, but we are also going to take a look at a few apps for older versions of iPhone that also enable you to create amazing portraits.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-iPhone-portrait-photos"><a href="#Tips-for-iPhone-portrait-photos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for iPhone portrait photos"></a>Tips for iPhone portrait photos</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 1: For iPhone 8, 7 or older iPhones users</a></li></ul><h3 id="For-iPhone-7-Plus-8-Plus-X-users"><a href="#For-iPhone-7-Plus-8-Plus-X-users" class="headerlink" title="For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users"></a>For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users</h3><p> <strong>Using the Portrait Mode on an iPhone</strong></p><p>The quality of cameras on iPhones has been improving over the years, and Portrait Mode on Apple’s twin-lens devices is the clear result of that process. All twin-lens iPhones have a Portrait mode that can be accessed through the menu located near the bottom of the camera app screen. Pano, Square or Time-Lapse modes are also available.</p><p>However, the Portrait Mode is only featured on iOS 10.1 or some more recent versions of the iOS, so if you want to use the Portrait Mode you need to upgrade your device’s iOS. After you launched the camera app, swipe left and look for the Portrait Mode. Once you find the feature, make sure it is marked yellow, in order to start using its tools. The app will display several different lighting options including the Natural Light preset that is essential for creating photos with Portrait Lightning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/portrait-mode-iphone.jpg"                      alt="portrait-mode-iphone"                ></p><p>Image resource: 9to5mac</p><p>Portrait mode enables you to set the timer, turn off the flash or apply photo filters, but it doesn’t allow its users to create live photos. When using this mode you only have to apply basic photography rules, like don’t point your camera in the direction from which the light is coming from and do your best to get within a reasonable distance from the subject of your photos. If you decide to take photos in this mode indoors, you may get slightly underwhelming results because it still doesn’t perform great in low-light conditions.</p><p><strong>Taking selfies in Portrait Mode with iPhone X</strong></p><p>The iPhone X can also take Portrait selfies thanks to the TrueDepth front camera system. Unlike the rear camera system, the front-facing camera doesn’t have multiple physical camera lenses; instead, it uses sensors from the TrueDepth system to measure a precise depth map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/portrait-mode-selfie-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="portrait-mode-selfie-iphone-x"                ></p><p>Image resource: imore</p><p>Launch the Camera app, and swipe to the Portrait option, and then tap on the Camera Swap feature to start using the front camera on your iPhone.

The so-called Bokeh effect adds depth to the photo and it also allows the photographer to separate the model in the foreground from the background. Furthermore, creating a portrait photo with Apple’s smartphones has never been easier, because the latest models of iPhones that have a twin-lens system make this process fun and easy.</p><p>In this article, we are going to show you how to take photos in Portrait Mode, on iPhone X, 8 Plus, and 7 Plus, but we are also going to take a look at a few apps for older versions of iPhone that also enable you to create amazing portraits.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-iPhone-portrait-photos-3"><a href="#Tips-for-iPhone-portrait-photos-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips for iPhone portrait photos"></a>Tips for iPhone portrait photos</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 1: For iPhone 8, 7 or older iPhones users</a></li></ul><h3 id="For-iPhone-7-Plus-8-Plus-X-users-3"><a href="#For-iPhone-7-Plus-8-Plus-X-users-3" class="headerlink" title="For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users"></a>For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users</h3><p> <strong>Using the Portrait Mode on an iPhone</strong></p><p>The quality of cameras on iPhones has been improving over the years, and Portrait Mode on Apple’s twin-lens devices is the clear result of that process. All twin-lens iPhones have a Portrait mode that can be accessed through the menu located near the bottom of the camera app screen. Pano, Square or Time-Lapse modes are also available.</p><p>However, the Portrait Mode is only featured on iOS 10.1 or some more recent versions of the iOS, so if you want to use the Portrait Mode you need to upgrade your device’s iOS. After you launched the camera app, swipe left and look for the Portrait Mode. Once you find the feature, make sure it is marked yellow, in order to start using its tools. The app will display several different lighting options including the Natural Light preset that is essential for creating photos with Portrait Lightning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/portrait-mode-iphone.jpg"                      alt="portrait-mode-iphone"                ></p><p>Image resource: 9to5mac</p><p>Portrait mode enables you to set the timer, turn off the flash or apply photo filters, but it doesn’t allow its users to create live photos. When using this mode you only have to apply basic photography rules, like don’t point your camera in the direction from which the light is coming from and do your best to get within a reasonable distance from the subject of your photos. If you decide to take photos in this mode indoors, you may get slightly underwhelming results because it still doesn’t perform great in low-light conditions.</p><p><strong>Taking selfies in Portrait Mode with iPhone X</strong></p><p>The iPhone X can also take Portrait selfies thanks to the TrueDepth front camera system. Unlike the rear camera system, the front-facing camera doesn’t have multiple physical camera lenses; instead, it uses sensors from the TrueDepth system to measure a precise depth map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/portrait-mode-selfie-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="portrait-mode-selfie-iphone-x"                ></p><p>Image resource: imore</p><p>Launch the Camera app, and swipe to the Portrait option, and then tap on the Camera Swap feature to start using the front camera on your iPhone. Find the Portrait Lightning feature in the camera’s Portrait mode, then select one of the options provided by the Portrait Lightning such as Studio Light or Natural light, and proceed to snap a selfie by tapping on the shutter button.</p><p>If there is not enough light or if you are too far away from the camera, the app will show messages that remind you to add more light to your shot or hold the camera closer to the subject of the photo. It is worth noting that the app will not let you take a photo until you do everything that messages on the screen demand from you. However, the Portrait Mode doesn’t allow you to take several photos at once, but it still produces amazing pictures that can be easily shared on social media.</p><h3 id="For-iPhone-8-7-or-older-iPhones-users-3"><a href="#For-iPhone-8-7-or-older-iPhones-users-3" class="headerlink" title="For iPhone 8, 7 or older iPhones users"></a>For iPhone 8, 7 or older iPhones users</h3><h4 id="FabFocus-3"><a href="#FabFocus-3" class="headerlink" title="FabFocus"></a><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fabfocus-portraits-with-depth-and-bokeh/id1080434313?mt=8" >FabFocus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $3.99</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> iOS 8.0 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezy-watermark-lite-photo.jpg"                      alt="ezy-watermark-lite-photo"                ></p><p>Older iPhone models may not have a twin-lens system, but with the aid of a camera app such as FabFocus, iPhone photographers can easily take photos with smooth blurry backgrounds.

It should match the resolution standards. There are generally two major terms that we follow in this category:</p><ul><li>First one is DCI 4K that deals with 4096x2160 pixels while maintaining 256:135 aspect ratio. This is the most commonly followed standard in film industry.</li><li>Second is UHD-1 that we often call as 4K for TV productions.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="NextGen-Cameras-Top-Picks-for-Professional-Videography-2024"><a href="#NextGen-Cameras-Top-Picks-for-Professional-Videography-2024" class="headerlink" title="NextGen Cameras: Top Picks for Professional Videography 2024"></a>NextGen Cameras: Top Picks for Professional Videography 2024</h2><p>When you ask an expert or a professional about which is the best camera of 2024, you’ll probably will receive a different answer from both. Depending on what you want to use it for, the best camera for recording YouTube videos won’t be the same as a camera you would pick for live streaming on Twitch, a holiday or for starting as an influencer. In this article we’ve collected a wide range of camera models at different price points, including, action cameras, smartphones, DSLR’s, mirrorless cameras and purpose-made cameras. All of the included cameras film video in completely different ways and some models are better alternatives than others.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right in!</p><h2 id="1-Fujifilm-X-S10"><a href="#1-Fujifilm-X-S10" class="headerlink" title="1. Fujifilm X-S10"></a>1. Fujifilm X-S10</h2><p>The Fujifilm’s X-S10 has a 26-megapixel interchangeable lens that shoots high-quality 4K video and has a deep grip and a different, though splendid, control scheme than other Fujifilm cameras. Fujifilm describes the X-S10 as a mix between the Fujifilm’s X-T30 and the X-H1 series. You get the strength from the previous model and the design and in-body photo stabilization. This X-S10 camera is suitable for both beginners and experienced users that use Nikon or Canon DSLR’s and want something a little more similar than a regular Fujifilm camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fujifilm-x-s10.jpg"                      alt="fujifilm x s10"                ></p><p>Fujifilm did not disclose what the S is standing for in the name of the X-S10, we think it might stand for ‘small’ or ‘slim’, or maybe ‘simple’. Let’s take a look at the details: the X-S10 measures 126 x 85x 65 mm and weighs 465 grams. For the dimensions, it lays between the X-T30 and the X-T4.</p><p><strong>Fujifilm X-S10 specifications</strong></p><ul><li>Single UHS-I card slot</li><li>5-axis in-body image stabilization</li><li>Wi-Fi + Bluetooth</li><li>On-sensor phase detection</li><li>325 shots per charge using LCD</li><li>26MP X-Trans BSI-CMOS sensor</li><li>3”, 1.04M-dot fully articulating touchscreen</li><li>30 fps burst shooting with crop (up to 20 fps without)</li><li>USB Power Delivery support</li><li>36M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</li><li>DCI and UHD 4K capture at up to 30p with F-Log support</li><li>External mic and headphone sockets</li></ul><h2 id="2-Canon-EOS-R5"><a href="#2-Canon-EOS-R5" class="headerlink" title="2. Canon EOS R5"></a>2. Canon EOS R5</h2><p>In our opinion, the Canon EOS R5 is by far Canon’s most precious product. It’s the perfect combination of the EOS R’s form, the EOS 5D’s function, together with the professional autofocus of the EOS-1D X. If you’re a hybrid or a stills shooter who shifts between videography and photography. It’s one of the most robust cameras you will ever own. It has achieved a lot of wrong attention, probably for overheating (or the possibility of it) when recording your videos in 8K resolution. But this should not decrease the quality of this camera’s incredible potential.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/canon-eos-r5.jpg"                      alt="canon eos r5"                ></p><p>With its frame rate and its video capabilities combined together, this is honestly a monumental camera. It’s taken the spot of the more expensive Sony A1 just to see how good this EOS R5 from Canon is. The Canon EOS R5 is incredible at photographing wildlife, it’s more or less a way around for capturing images of animals and people, or other objects from far away or close-up shots.</p><p>For the professional photographer who needs speed, video capabilities and resolution, there is the Canon EOS R5. Setting a new boundary for versatility, the full-frame mirrorless camera contains a perfectly designed 45-megapixel CMOS sensor, which offers 12 fps continuous shooting with a mechanical shutter, 8K raw video recording. It’s the first EOS camera to contain a 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilizer.</p><p><strong>Canon EOS R5 specifications</strong></p><ul><li>ISO range: 100-51,200 (expandable to 50-102,400)</li><li>Image processor: Digic X</li><li>AF points: 5,940 Dual Pixel CMOS AF II</li><li>Sensor: 45MP full-frame CMOS 36 x 24mm</li><li>Max image size: 8,192 x 5,464px</li><li>Video: 8K DCI or UHD at 30p, 24p &#x2F; 4K DCI or UHD at 120p, 100p, 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p &#x2F; 1080p (FullHD) at 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p</li><li>Max burst: 12fps mechanical shutter, 20fps electronic shutter</li><li>Viewfinder: 0.5-inch OLED EVF, 5,690k dots, 100% coverage, 0.76x magnification, 120fps refresh rate</li><li>Memory card: 1x CFexpress type B, 1x UHS-II SD&#x2F;SDHC&#x2F;SDXC</li><li>Stabilization: 5-axis, up to 8 stops</li><li>Metering zones: 384</li><li>LCD: 3.15-inch fully articulating touchscreen, 2,100k dots.</li><li>Connectivity: Wi-Fi 5Ghz and 2.4GHz, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2), micro HDMI (type D), microphone, headphone, N3 remote, flash sync, gigabit ethernet (via WFT-R10 grip)</li></ul><h2 id="3-Nikon-D3500"><a href="#3-Nikon-D3500" class="headerlink" title="3. Nikon D3500"></a>3. Nikon D3500</h2><p>The Nikon D3500 is one of the best DSLR cameras available for beginners that are looking to create stunning, manual photos using a regular setup. While it’s containing great image quality, easy-to-use menus and a superior battery life, this camera offers incredible value. Mirrorless competition should also be contemplated, especially when you want 4K resolution or a touch screen for easier use. After our review, this Nikon’s entry-level DSLR keeps the lead by giving the type of value and quality that mirrorless cameras do not succeed to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/nikon-d3500.jpg"                      alt="nikon d3500"                ></p><p>When you are searching for a smaller camera for recording traveling content, other mirrorless options like the Canon EOS M50 Mark II or Fujifilm X-T200 are great possibilities too. When it comes to an affordable camera for starters, the Nikon D3500 is the perfect solution. The D3500’s ISO sensitivity range of 100-25,600 is quite wide and doesn’t improve on the D3400’s range.</p><p>Nikon decided to keep the same 3-inch display, including the 921,000-dot resolution from the D3400 model. If you desire a DSLR with a vari-angle display, then you should explore the range to the Nikon D5600.</p><p>Seeing the rear screen is an optical viewfinder. This is perhaps the clearest feature that distinguishes DSLR’s from mirrorless cameras. Many mirrorless cameras barely show on the rear screen for shooting, while other models will include viewfinders with quite better resolutions.</p><p><strong>Nikon D3500 Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Camera type: DSLR</li><li>Sensor: 24.2MP APS-C CMOS 4, 23.5 x 15.6mm</li><li>Lens mount: Nikon F</li><li>In-body image stabilization (IBIS): No</li><li>Full frame: No</li><li>AF points: 11-point AF, 1 cross-type</li><li>Image processor: EXPEED 4</li><li>Memory card: SD&#x2F;SDHC&#x2F;SDXC UHS I</li><li>Max image size: 6,000 x 4,000px</li><li>ISO range: 100 to 25,600</li><li>Video: 1920 x 1080 at 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p</li><li>Metering zones: 420 pixel RGB sensor</li><li>Viewfinder: Optical pentamirror, 95% coverage</li><li>Max burst: 5fps</li><li>LCD: 3.0-inch fixed, 921K dots</li><li>Size: 124 x 97 x 69.5mm (body only)</li><li>Connectivity: Bluetooth</li><li>Weight: 415g (body only, with battery and memory card)</li></ul><h2 id="4-Olympus-OM-D-E-M10-Mark-IV"><a href="#4-Olympus-OM-D-E-M10-Mark-IV" class="headerlink" title="4. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV"></a>4. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV</h2><p>Introducing the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV! This is the entry-level camera in Olympus’s DSLR range of Micro Four Thirds models. This is definitely an upgrade from the beginner-range E-PL range, giving you more control, also improved quality and a wide range of features. This camera contains a 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor, flip-down touchscreen, an in-body image stabilizer, an easy-to-use interface and of course the 4K video option. The E-M10 IV is out now in two types of kits, a black or silver body including the compact 14-42mm F3.5-5.6 EZ lens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/olympus-omd-em10.jpg"                      alt="olympus omd em10"                ></p><p>The camera’s continuous autofocus has been redesigned using techniques from the E-M1X model. This reduces occurrences of the camera locking focus to the background and not focusing on your predetermined topic.</p><p>Olympus did also add a Live View Boost option that allows you to make both focusing and framing in darker environments a lot easier. The E-M10 III’s Live View Boost option hardly increases the viewfinder drive, but on the E-M10 IV it can also diminish the frame rate. This allows a substantially more luminant viewfinder frame.</p><p>The E-M10 IV is still employing a contrast-detect autofocus structure, For us it’s not a problem, even while shooting in 4K resolution. We noticed that the night display mode is way easier to use but implements only to the Remote Shutter screen. Its more red scheme supports in protecting your night vision while filming night skies, it does allows your external light source to be quickly changed with a vertical wipe onto the screen</p><p><strong>Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>5-axis in-body image stabilization (up to 4.5 stops)</li><li>20 Megapixel Live MOS sensor (Four Thirds)</li><li>121-point contrast-detect AF system</li><li>Wi-Fi + Bluetooth</li><li>Flip-down touchscreen display</li><li>TruePic VIII processor</li><li>USB charging</li><li>Electronic viewfinder</li><li>360 shots per charge (with LCD)</li><li>5 fps burst shooting w&#x2F;AF</li></ul><h2 id="5-DJI-Pocket-2"><a href="#5-DJI-Pocket-2" class="headerlink" title="5. DJI Pocket 2"></a>5. DJI Pocket 2</h2><p>The DJI Pocket 2 is a second-generation all-in-one camera that has an amazing built-in three-axis stabilizer. This camera stays about the same capacity as the regular, and contains a wider lens, bigger sensor, more microphones, an improved autofocus system, with the option to film higher-quality videos photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-pocket-2.jpg"                      alt="dji pocket 2"                ></p><p>The design of the Pocket 2 is almost the same to the original and it holds a Mini Control Stick that shove into the area previously kept free for a smartphone placement. When you are using the Mini Control Stick, the buttons to operate the Pocket will increase to five from two. We want to mention that there are a few changes with the button design, the operation is still natural just like the original.</p><p>The DJI Pocket comes standard with all accessories to use with your smartphone without the Do-It-All handle.</p><p>You need to tilt and zoom using the smartphone app, and that is not as spontaneous as the Mini Control Stick. The Do-It-All handle is perfect for using your smartphone like the screen. It’s crucial to download the Mimo application and the Do-It-All handle if you want to go stream.</p><p>The microphone quality on the Pocket is something to go for because of the extra microphones. It makes it super easy for recordings to sound way better than regular smartphones. The Pocket 2 has the option to shoot 3x3 panoramas. The 180º panorama captures four pictures and combines them into one long photo, while the 3x3 panorama mode captures 9 images and then puts them into a 5x7 image. We recommend a tripod with 3x3 panoramas to cancel out any camera shakes.</p><p><strong>DJI Pocket 2 Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>DJI Pocket 2 specifications:</li><li>20mm (equiv.)

GoPro Hero 10 Black"></a>6. GoPro Hero 10 Black</h2><p>When we think about action cameras designed for sports, GoPro is the first thing that comes to mind. According to our records, the GoPro Hero 10 Black is GoPro’s new leader for 2024. It resembles a similar layout and the same sensor introduced on the GoPro Hero 9 Black edition. This camera is packed with a new processor. While the screens on the GoPro’s are LCD’s, they are not as crisp as AMOLED panels. The GoPro Hero 10 Black’s interface is the same as what previous GoPro’s. Wipe your finger to browse through the menus to go back and forth between the modes. Swipe up to show the video files on the memory card and swipe down to enter the camera settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg"                      alt="gopro hero 10 black"                ></p><p>We can all agree that the GoPro Hero 9 Black is a solid camera, but its (sometimes) unresponsive LCD screen kind of broke people’s expectations. GoPro handles feedback really well and the camera also boasts quicker frame rates. The entire GoPro experience also saw a punch up in terms of experiences. The GoPro app now reinforces wired transfers and better live streaming support. This GoPro Hero 10 Black also showcases a new HyperSmooth 4.0 stabilization, which keeps video steadier.</p><p>We like to point out that it is a good idea to consider that there is no headphone jack, microphone input and video output, because there will already be a built-in microphone and speaker on the GoPro Hero 10.</p><p><strong>GoPro Hero 10 Black Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>GoPro Hero 10 Black specifications:</li><li>Higher video framerates</li><li>Top-of-the-line digital stabilization</li><li>WiFi and Bluetooth Supported</li><li>More effiecient wire transfer</li><li>Digital Image Stabilization</li><li>1720 mAh rechargeable battery capacity via USB type-C</li><li>The new lens cover can repel water</li><li>No tripod mount and accessory shoe</li><li>Better and improved user interface</li><li>Waterproof of upto 10m</li><li>Doubled processor power</li><li>Interval Recording</li><li>No built-in light&#x2F;flash</li><li>Creative Effects</li><li>Burst Mode</li></ul><h2 id="7-Nikon-Z6-II"><a href="#7-Nikon-Z6-II" class="headerlink" title="7. Nikon Z6 II"></a>7. Nikon Z6 II</h2><p>The Nikon Z6 II is equipped with a whopping 24-megapixel sensor, it lays perfectly between processing power and resolution, a lot of people like the option to the professional grade Nikon Z7 II which comes with about the double megapixel count. There are not many differences between this camera and its forerunner. A difference is “II” nomenclature after the Z6 mark. We figured that it’s just a couple of millimeters deeper. We know that the Z6 II is the cheaper model of the two, one is more-affordable and better designed compared to the more-expensive brother, the Z7 II. Nikon chose to keep both the Z6 and the Z7 in its range so there’s would not be a reason why the upgrades available wouldn’t fit you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/nikon-z6-ii.jpg"                      alt="nikon z6 ii"                ></p><p>We noticed that most of the Z6 II’s buttons are paired together to the right of the camera, so you can make changes with your fingers. The set of dials on the front and side of the grip feel natural to control aperture and its shutter speed. You see buttons for settings such as video recording, exposure compensation and ISO on the side. Even though there are no disappointments when talking about image quality. The Z6 II expresses the same sensor as its forerunner.</p><p>Personalize the controls on the Z6 II, on an attached lens and also on the body. You can navigate to the menu and configure these settings from there. In this camera model you also find the possibility to adjust how the focus ring acts on Z lenses (besides the Noct lens, which is not focus-by-wire).

This device is available with payment of US $130 only but it promises surprising services that are comparable to high end units. 4K upscaling ability is one of the best feature and further it provides impressive full HD 3D support.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>This player offers excellent quality for Blu-Ray images.</li><li>Comes with a dual core processor.</li><li>Possesses built in dual band Wi-Fi.</li><li>Interactive user interface.</li><li>It has multi room support feature.</li><li>Impressive streaming services with wide selection range.</li><li>DVD upscaling supported.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>It has received average rating for build quality.</li><li>4K upscaling is not so fine.</li><li>Bluetooth often causes undesired noise in signals.</li><li>It works preferably only on Android devices; does not extend support to iOS platforms.</li></ul><h2 id="Features-3"><a href="#Features-3" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p>The BDP-S6700 is capable enough to fulfil almost all requirements of buyers, it provides eye catching results for Blu-ray, can spin 3D discs, processed CDs and DVDs with high quality content but it lacks to provide support for DVD audio. You will be glad to know that this device can perfectly handle DTS HD Master audio and Dolby TrueHD content.

Further, you can enjoy DLNA connectivity and Miracast screen mirroring facility for displaying content on smartphones or TV screen directly. Gamers will love to explore their gaming world on BDP-S6700 as it assists in easy streaming from cloud based systems but you will need wireless DualShock 4 controller for this purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/s6700-4.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BTTHXZU/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01BTTHXZU&linkId=5ae6fc2ca446cead03647aa90ee00feb" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Operation-3"><a href="#Operation-3" class="headerlink" title="Operation"></a>Operation</h2><p>This device offers an intuitive home screen feature where everything can be accessed easily on well managed series of tiles.

Sadly, the DLNA option is not available on Home Screen by default but you can add that manually.</p><p>Other than this, streamlined menu helps users to find their desired content with ease and will continue services when you are connected to DLNA devices.
