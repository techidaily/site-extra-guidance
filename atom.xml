These splits are so powerful that you can very easily isolate a single word or even a single letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-exploder-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text exploder plugin"                ></p><h2 id="iExpressions-2"><a href="#iExpressions-2" class="headerlink" title="iExpressions 2"></a>iExpressions 2</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/" >https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to effectively use the After Effects expressions even if you are not familiar with coding, iExpressions 2 is the text plugin to consider. It comes with 22 ready-to-use iExpressions that you can easily customize to fit into your project and it is so easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/iexpression-2-plugin.jpg"                      alt="iexpression 2 plugin"                ></p><h2 id="TextBox"><a href="#TextBox" class="headerlink" title="TextBox"></a>TextBox</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textbox/" >https://aescripts.com/textbox/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to create the perfect shape behind your text, then TextBox is a good text plugin to consider. This is a native After Effects plugin, meaning that you will not need to install it and the shapes it creates can be very easily customized. It updates the shapes you create automatically and adds them to the text layer, making it the most ideal solution to create closed captions, lower thirds, and subtitles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-box-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text box plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Font-Manager"><a href="#Font-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Font Manager"></a>Font Manager</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/font-manager/" >https://aescripts.com/font-manager/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Font Manager is an After Effects text plugin that is useful when creating and working with animated typefaces. You can use it to create the most complex animated text graphics in just a few simple clicks. You will also find it very familiar to use as the user interface is similar to the Character Panel in After Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/font-manager-plugin.jpg"                      alt="font manager plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Cartoon-Moblur"><a href="#Cartoon-Moblur" class="headerlink" title="Cartoon Moblur"></a>Cartoon Moblur</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony. If you have used the motion blur effect in After Effects, Cartoon Moblur will behave in a similar function, but it is more suited to 2D, flat or minimal graphics. Some of the factors that you can customize include the length of the blur (shutter angle), color, and opacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cartoon-moblur-plugin.jpg"                      alt="cartoon moblur plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Shadow-Studio"><a href="#Shadow-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Shadow Studio"></a>Shadow Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for shadow styles that will go very well with your project, Shadow Studio is a good plugin to get. It offers you a wide variety of shadow styles including radial, inner, soft, and long shadows. Most people find it an easier and more affordable way to add soft shadows as compared to traditional methods like raytracing. It is also quite easy to use, meaning that shadow effects that would take hours to complete can be done in a matter of minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/shadow-studio-plugin.jpg"                      alt="shadow studio plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Texts-Animation-Bundle"><a href="#Texts-Animation-Bundle" class="headerlink" title="Texts Animation Bundle"></a>Texts Animation Bundle</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/" >https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is a bundle of more than 80 different templates to add text effects to any text in After Effects. All the templates in the bundle are easily customizable and the plugin is very easy to use, allowing you to create amazing text effects in just a few clicks. The templates are modeled from various titles, quotes, and stories, so there is a little bit of something for everyone. Plus, the bundle gets constant updates and you are likely to get new templates with each update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/texts-animation-bundle-plugin.jpg"                      alt="texts animation bundle plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Artificial-Intelligence-Titles"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence Titles"></a>Artificial Intelligence Titles</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://videohive.net/item/ait-artificial-intelligence-titles/22124640?s_rank=1" >https://videohive.net/item/ait-artificial-intelligence-titles/22124640?s%5Frank=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Artificial Intelligence Titles is an After Effects text plugin that is designed to be the ultimate typographical solution. Once you have it in After Effects, you can enter any text and the plugin will automatically adjust the entire layout of the text. You can choose to create awesome text boxes, change the color, add special effects and even change the duration, speed, size, and positioning of the text. It also allows users to customize the text animation’s direction without using a keyframe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/artificial-intelligence-titles-plugin.jpg"                      alt="artificial intelligence titles plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Text-Library"><a href="#Text-Library" class="headerlink" title="Text Library"></a>Text Library</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://videohive.net/item/text-library-handy-text-animations/21932974" >https://videohive.net/item/text-library-handy-text-animations/21932974 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is another great text animation bundle with different options for just about any kind of project. But unlike other plugin bundles that only have a few effects to choose from, Text Library has thousands of templates to choose from. Once you have selected the template that you would like to use, you also get the option to customize the template to suit your project. You can customize the text, size, duration of the animation, and color. It is easy to use and is constantly updated to introduce even more templates with each update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-library-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text library plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>On its own After Effects comes with so many post-production effects and features to make your project appear professional and well made. But if you would like to have a unique video production that stands head and shoulders above all others, plugins are a great way to do that. The good news is that After Effects allows for the use of plugins developed by third-party developers and some of the them like the text plugins, we have listed above can be very useful to a video’s production.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-introducing-windows-xps-media-production-hub/"><u>2024 Approved  Introducing Windows XP's Media Production Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-navigating-telegram-web-applications/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the Art of Navigating Telegram Web Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/leading-action-cams-that-keep-moving-steady-for-2024/"><u>Leading Action Cams That Keep Moving Steady for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-optimize-your-yi-4k-footage-best-accessories-list/"><u>[New] Optimize Your YI 4K Footage - Best Accessories List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-screen-sleeves-on-sony-a6400-block-video-playback/"><u>2024 Approved  Screen Sleeves on Sony A6400 Block Video Playback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/methods-for-rolling-macos-sierra-back-to-el-capitan-for-2024/"><u>Methods for Rolling MacOS Sierra Back to El Capitan for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-stabilized-snapshots-best-tripods-for-iphonesandroids/"><u>[New] Stabilized Snapshots  Best Tripods for iPhones/Androids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mastering-brand-collaboration-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Brand Collaboration on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/navigating-timecodes-and-text-in-srt-with-macos-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Timecodes and Text in SRT with macOS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/reimagining-received-gifts-the-joy-of-openness-for-2024/"><u>Reimagining Received Gifts  The Joy of Openness for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-top-choices-excellent-youtubers-screen-recording-tools/"><u>[New] Top Choices  Excellent YouTubers' Screen Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-strategic-visual-marketing-top-10-ideas-to-amplify-your-instagram-presence/"><u>[New] Strategic Visual Marketing  Top 10 Ideas to Amplify Your Instagram Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/unlock-your-online-potential-with-these-top-tips-on-free-youtube-transcripts-for-2024/"><u>Unlock Your Online Potential with These Top Tips on FREE YouTube Transcripts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/lava-music-recovery-recover-deleted-music-from-lava-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>Lava Music Recovery - Recover Deleted Music from Lava</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-vivo-y200-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Vivo Y200?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Key-Picks-The-Best-6-Online-Communities-for-Enterprise-Expansion"><a href="#Key-Picks-The-Best-6-Online-Communities-for-Enterprise-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="Key Picks: The Best 6 Online Communities for Enterprise Expansion"></a>Key Picks: The Best 6 Online Communities for Enterprise Expansion</h2><p>Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg"                      alt="instagram app"                ></p><p>Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.</p><h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking. It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg"                      alt="linkedin app"                ></p><p>LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what’s the best social media platform for your business? I think the answer is different for everyone. The important thing is that you find out where your customers are and how they use social media. Then, you can join them on their favorite platforms and connect with them there.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="IPhone-User-Guide-to-HDR-Image-Creation"><a href="#IPhone-User-Guide-to-HDR-Image-Creation" class="headerlink" title="IPhone User Guide to HDR Image Creation"></a>IPhone User Guide to HDR Image Creation</h2><p>Are you annoyed that your iPhone camera is unable to capture what your eyes see? Well, no need to waste your energy. The iPhone camera offers just the perfect feature to counter this problem - the HDR feature.</p><p>Most people have to use photo editing software to fix the exposures of photos, but luckily for us, we don’t need that.</p><p>In this article, we will give you a brief overview of HDR photography and then guide you on how to shoot HDR photos with an iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?</h2><p>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range, and it refers to a photography technique where multiple exposures of a scene are combined to create one well-lit picture. It captures a scene’s darkest and lightest tone and shows them as such in the final photo.</p><p>Apple introduced the HDR feature back in 2010 on iPhone 4. It was a breakthrough for the company, further enhancing the iPhone camera. Since then, all the succeeding models of the iPhone have the HDR feature.</p><p>However, Apple has advanced its HDR technology with the passage of time. Before the release of the iPhone 12, Apple worked with HDR10. With the iPhone 12, Apple inculcated Dolby Vision HDR, becoming the first to roll out Dolby Vision in a mobile handset.</p><p>Without the HDR feature, your iPhone camera is not capable of capturing a high-contrast scene. This will lead you to having exposure problems in your pictures.</p><p>Your scene might have dark tones that are well exposed with the right colors and details, but the bright areas might be over-exposed with no shade or detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot"                ></p><p>On the other hand, your scene might have bright tones that are well-exposed with the right color and details, but the dark areas are too dark to show the details.</p><p>Alt text: HDR shoot with different exposure</p><p>With the iPhone’s HDR feature, you can get a perfectly exposed photo showing details simultaneously in light and dark tones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot with different exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?"></a>Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?</h2><p>Now that we know how HDR helps make our pictures pop out, let’s look at how you can take an HDR photo with your iPhone camera.</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?"></a>How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?</h3><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow. This guide is applicable for iPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>The first step for you is to go to your iPhone Settings. Here, click on the Camera app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and click on camera"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Adjust-the-Settings"><a href="#Step2Adjust-the-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step2Adjust the Settings"></a>Step2Adjust the Settings</h5><p>Here, ensure that the Smart HDR (or Auto HDR in iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X) is toggled off. The HDR option will not be available in the camera if you do not switch this off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="turn on smart hdr"                ></p><p>Also, ensure that the “Keep Normal Photo” toggle is on. Having this enabled will let your camera save a non-HDR version of the photo as well as the HDR version.</p><h5 id="Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Step3Head to the Camera App"></a>Step3Head to the Camera App</h5><p>Once you have adjusted the setting, open the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step4Enable-HDR"><a href="#Step4Enable-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Step4Enable HDR"></a>Step4Enable HDR</h5><p>At the top of the screen, you will see an HDR option. Tap on it to enable (or disable) it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="go the camera and click on hrd from top menu"                ></p><p>In older iPhones such as iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and earlier, you have the option to set it to Auto, On, or Off. Choose the “On” option.</p><p>You can now take HDR photos with your iPhone!</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?"></a>How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?</h3><p>In the iPhone 13 models, the steps for taking an HDR photo are slightly different. The first few steps are the same. Go to Settings &gt; Camera. Under the HDR section, find the “HDR” option and turn the toggle on.</p><p>Once the toggle is on, go to the Camera app. You will see the HDR option where you can turn it On&#x2F;Off or set it to Automatic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?</h2><p>You may notice that when you shoot photos with HDR on your iPhone, your camera roll shows two identical pictures. This happens when the “Keep Normal Photo” setting is enabled in the iPhone Camera Settings. This setting is only available on iPhone X and earlier.</p><p>For the latest versions, you can only see the Smart HDR option. By default, Smart HDR does not save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><p>The “Keep Normal Photo” option is helpful in instances where you might have to compare the HDR and non-HDR versions. You may even prefer the non-HDR version in some cases.</p><p>But the side effect of this feature is that it becomes a nuisance to delete the other versions, and it also takes up space.</p><p>Here is how you can disable this setting and avoid having two same photos.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings-1"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>Go to your iPhone Settings and tap on the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option"><a href="#Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option"></a>Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option</h5><p>You will see a “Keep Normal Photo” toggle in the HDR panel. Turn the toggle off.</p><p>Once the toggle is off, you can go and take an HDR photo. The camera app will no longer save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?"></a>Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?</h2><p>The iPhone’s HDR option enables you to get great shots. Apple introduced a “Smart HDR” option on iPhone where the camera shoots photos in HDR (when necessary) by default. This option ensures that users don’t have to go to great lengths to get amazing shots.</p><p>However, there may be instances when you feel that the “Smart HDR” option is not working.</p><h3 id="Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App"></a><strong>Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App</strong></h3><p>There may be a case where you open your Camera app to take a picture in HDR but there is no HDR option available to you. This is usually the case with iPhone 13 models, and its pro variants.</p><p>Well, the reason behind it is that Apple has added a new feature in these models that the Camera is set to capture HDR shots by default. So, users do not have the option to control the HDR feature.</p><p>It certainly takes away the control that users had in their shots because not all HDR images turn out to be perfect. Especially while zooming into things, the images start looking like a painting. However, it works just fine in most cases.</p><h3 id="Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max"></a><strong>Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max</strong></h3><p>Certain iPhone XS Max users are facing a problem where the Photos app does not show whether the image is an HDR image or not. Previously, users could see an “HDR” tag on their photos. However, recently the tags are not visible anymore.</p><p>Worry not, this does not mean that your Smart HDR is not working. You can check this by disabling Smart HDR from Settings &gt; Camera. Once Smart HDR is disabled, go to the Camera app and take a picture without HDR. Compare the before and after images to see if your HDR feature is working or not.</p><p>Such instances of Smart HDR may occur but you don’t need to worry too much about them. The simple solutions mentioned above will surely fix your problem. In case they don’t help, you can contact the Apple Support to get your queries resolved.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device"><a href="#Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device"></a>Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device</h2><p>HDR photography is a really cool technique that can really make your content more appealing.

There are undisputed leaders present in this segment but their product and price doesn’t fulfil the needs of each and every buyer. More choices always put pressure on leaders and consequently make the product better for the ultimate buyer! Panasonic has proved it yet again with its HX-A1 <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wearable Action Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Polaroid XS 100 Review &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> With an unconventional cylindrical design, this digital camcorder is ready to make you fall for it. Panasonic has always tried to add versatility to their product and this focus has helped to win the hearts of its fans! HX-A1 Wearable Action Camera, as its name suggests, helps to mount it to any ideal spot. Its elongated torch-like shape helps in mounting it to your helmet, board or any other piece of mountain gear. You can attach it to your bag, hat or backpack or just put it like a headband! The twin mount helps in clicking in dark situations especially where you need an IR flashlight. Its 0 lux night vision mode allows IR flashlight to be mounted in addition to A1. The camera allows to film in 1080p at 30fps, 720p at 60fps and 480p at 240fps. Available at a very affordable price of $101.95, A1 is certainly compatible to exceed your expectations. Let us unfold aspects of this A1 camera in this post.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Usability"><a href="#Design-and-Usability" class="headerlink" title="Design and Usability"></a>Design and Usability</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panasonic-hx-a1-design.jpg"                      alt="panasonic-hx-a1-design"                ></p><p> The elongated cylindrical body of this camera is very compact and less quirky and helps in operating it as a single component system. It is available in luminous orange and black colour variants and both of them look smart and classy. Its shock-proof, freeze-proof and dustproof makes it stand out exceptionally. It is compliant with IPX8 and thus you are free from hassles of adding a separate waterproof case! With a weight of only 45 gms, A1 is one of those few smallest action cameras which are easy and safe to carry. There is no built-in screen and the basic three buttons for its functioning rest on top of the camera, which can be termed as one of its shortcoming in design, as it tends to roll from sides when is set down, and thus can damage these controls if not kept carefully. These three buttons help in turning on the device, toggle recording and switch between video, still image and slow motion modes. Its built-in WiFi module allows the camera to connect to the smartphone and then transfer the media easily.

The Infra-Red lens can be used with your IR flashlight for recording in 0 Lux night vision mode. This means that action doesn’t stop when the sun goes down. If you are the one who is willing to record after dark for that extra dimension then this night vision mode will prove to be ideal for camping, night hiking, caving adventures and filming nocturnal wildlife. Even though it requires purchase of compatible IR flashlight, it brings out the best in pictures.</p><p> A range of mounts are available but A1 comes packaged with only Multi and Tripod mounts. Using Multi-mount, you can mount A1 to any ideal spot. As mentioned earlier that it can be curvy or any flat surface. The mounts have a hoop which secures it firmly. Tripod Mount helps in opening up more possibilities of mounting.</p><h4 id="Other-Optional-Accessories"><a href="#Other-Optional-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Other Optional Accessories"></a>Other Optional Accessories</h4><p> The rest of the Panasonic accessories have to be purchased separately as they can help in escalating the usefulness of this device.</p><h4 id="Extended-battery"><a href="#Extended-battery" class="headerlink" title="Extended battery"></a>Extended battery</h4><p> By adding weight of just 1.7 ounces to this 45g device, the extended battery of 750mAh adds upto 2.X more recording time which is worth investing!

Video and photo quality"></a><strong>1. Video and photo quality</strong></h4><p> The 2.6mm F2.8 lens and 1&#x2F;3-inch MOS sensor does a pretty notable job in recording 1080p Full HD video at 30 fps or 720p if you want 60 fps. Absence of 4K resolution and high competition really needed to deliver top-notch video quality. A1 complements very well with contrasts in brightness and its tender picture quality softens the detail a little. The point to be kept in mind is that Slow motion video recording is only available in the non-HD 480p resolution. It also allows you to continuously take 2.7-megapixel snapshots at a set interval. So its video and photo quality can be termed as decent!</p><h4 id="2-Night-Version"><a href="#2-Night-Version" class="headerlink" title="2. Night-Version"></a><strong>2.

The A1 is IP68 compliant, which means it has a capacity down to a depth of 1.5 metres (5 feet) of water and completely dustproof. It’s also rated to survive drops of up to 1.5 metres and is freeze-proof to -10 degrees Celsius or 14 degrees Fahrenheit, so now you don’t need to cancel your plans due to extreme weather conditions. .</p><h4 id="6-Image-APP"><a href="#6-Image-APP" class="headerlink" title="6. Image APP"></a><strong>6. Image APP</strong></h4><p> A1 connectivity to the Image App eases out its usage drastically. It gives a gateway to adjust the resolution and also provides access to various white balance options including dalylight and cloudy for outdoor and some user and automatic configured ones for indoor shoots. This app can also be used for live preview and toggling record acting as camera’s screen after complete configuration.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> The minor drawbacks in A1 are completely understandable. With its decent picture quality and plenty of other features such as SFDW formula, it can be rightly said that Panasonic has created a fine budget camera which is worth investing. There is always a way to capture your fun and thrills and Panasonic HX-A1 gets along your making it a capable action camera!</p><p> Looking for action cameras with low budget? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check best action cameras under 100 now. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-premium-audio-modification-solutions-magically-effective/"><u>[Updated] Premium Audio Modification Solutions  Magically Effective</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-iphone-night-scene-mastery-guide/"><u>[New] IPhone Night Scene Mastery Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-master-mac-streaming-with-our-top-5-software-picks/"><u>[Updated] Master Mac Streaming with Our Top 5 Software Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/side-by-side-hero4-vs-hero5-analysis-for-2024/"><u>Side by Side  Hero4 vs Hero5 Analysis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/straightforward-strategies-accessing-appreciated-comments-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Straightforward Strategies  Accessing Appreciated Comments on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-leading-directory-of-cost-free-online-resources-for-superior-vector-graphics/"><u>[Updated] Leading Directory of Cost-Free Online Resources for Superior Vector Graphics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-mastering-supplementary-video-for-enhanced-storytelling/"><u>[New] Mastering Supplementary Video for Enhanced Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-instant-video-mastery-editing-made-effortless-in-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] Instant Video Mastery  Editing Made Effortless in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-launch-your-wealth-journey-on-periscope-platform/"><u>[Updated] Launch Your Wealth Journey on Periscope Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-next-gen-media-masters-5-top-mac-videography-apps/"><u>[New] Next-Gen Media Masters  5 Top Mac Videography Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-10-online-video-tools-perfecting-webcam-footage-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top 10 Online Video Tools  Perfecting Webcam Footage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-are-you-eager-to-discover-the-top-rated-and-reliable-luts-that-can-be-used-in-shotcut-this-article-will-help-you-a-lot-with-this-matter/"><u>New In 2024, Are You Eager to Discover the Top-Rated and Reliable LUTs that Can Be Used in Shotcut?

For example, images and sounds are superimposed over what users see and hear.</p><p> Unlike <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where computer generated environments are used to interact with human beings and human beings get immersed into them, AR takes the real world of the present and projects digital imagery and sound into it.</p><p> The presentation of augmented reality is in some form of futuristic technology, despite the fact that it has been around for many years. For example, the heads-up display in many fighter jets utilizes the principles of augmented reality, and these date back to the early 1990s when they were used to show information about altitude, speed and direction of the aircraft.</p><h2 id="How-does-Augmented-Reality-work"><a href="#How-does-Augmented-Reality-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Augmented Reality work"></a>How does Augmented Reality work</h2><p> The kind of augmented reality you are likely to experience these days utilizes a range of sensors such as cameras and computer components as well as display devices in creating the illusion of virtual objects in the real world. Some of the smartphones in the market today have all the necessary components needed in the creation of augmented reality hence they are commonly used for most of AR experiences. The basic working of augmented reality is as follows-:</p><p> In general, the device will search for a particular object, which can be anything, but in most cases, they are usually 2D images like in the form of a movie poster. The augmented reality application will recognize the target through the camera and it will then process the image and augment it in some form through the utilization of sound and pictures. For example, if the target object was a movie poster, you may see it spring into life to play a trailer of the movie. So long as you continue viewing the poster through the “window” of the display object, you will see augmented reality rather than the plain old normal poster in normal reality.</p><h2 id="The-future-of-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#The-future-of-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="The future of Augmented Reality"></a>The future of Augmented Reality</h2><p> The future of augmented reality has never been brighter as it is at the moment. Though mobile devices are the primary avenues for VR at the moment, this is not expected to remain the case since a lot of developments, enhancements and innovations are currently taking place in the industry. For instance, work is currently on in the development of augmented reality ear buds which will allow users to adjust sounds coming from the environment.</p><p> There is also ongoing research on AR for contact lenses and other wearable devices. The chief aim of augmented reality is to avail natural and convenient immersions and this practically means that the current mobile devices used for AR will be replaced, though it is still not known what exactly will replace them.</p><p> Like with every new technology, augmented reality comes with a plethora or ethical and political issues. For example, the Google Glass came along with a lot of privacy concerns, with some people worried that pictures may be snapped or conversations may be recorded surreptitiously. But amidst all these concerns, AR technology is expected to gather more steam in the near future and it will be a part of life for the majority.</p><h2 id="Applications-of-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#Applications-of-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Applications of Augmented Reality"></a>Applications of Augmented Reality</h2><p> Augmented reality is used widely across different industries for various applications, with education and gaming taking the lion’s share of the uses. Discussed below are some of the applications of augmented reality:</p><ul><li><strong>Video Games</strong></li></ul><p> Playstation and Xbox are the main video game consoles where augmented reality capabilities have been included in their latest releases in the form of Kinetic and Playstation Eye for Xbox and Playstation respectively. Since gamers face both camera and the screen during the game play, players can see themselves in the game, where they have the ability to interact with the game characters just as if they were in the same room.</p><p> In addition to Playstation and Xbox implementation of augmented reality in their consoles, there are also mobile augmented reality games and these are available on tablets, smartphones and handheld consoles like Playstation Vita and the Nintendo 3DS.</p><ul><li><strong>Education</strong></li></ul><p> The potential of augmented reality in education is immense. Currently, the technology is widely applied in fields such as medicine in the simulation of 3D models used for teaching students. It is also possible to use existing learning materials like pages of a textbook in augmented reality. For instance, by targeting the picture of an engine in an engineering textbook, augmented reality can be used to animate the picture of the engine or even a working 3D model of the heart for better comprehension by the learners.</p><ul><li><strong>Medicine</strong></li></ul><p> In medicine, augmented reality is used to project information on the patient’s body. For instance, the Veinviewer system is currently being used to project images of vein scans directly on the human skin to make it easier for the medics to locate where the various veins are. With this kind of application, the skin appears to be “transparent” and the clinicians can easily see the veins directly.</p><ul><li><strong>Shopping</strong></li></ul><p> Augmented reality is expected to change the shape of commerce, equipping shoppers with the ability to browse the entire catalogs of favorite brands or stores in a more interactive manner. Through the technology, parks and airports could be turned into shopping destinations which will not just be an awesome way to kill time, but also an inventive way for businesses to save a lot of money in commercial real estate.</p><ul><li><strong>Augmented Reality in Travel</strong></li></ul><p> For travel, augmented reality can be used to provide budget “travel” options or quick “getaway” to places and sites you have always longed to visit.

For greater control, you may add a curve to your fading automation. To achieve this, choose the Automation Curve Tool by clicking on the Tool Selector at the top of the Arrangement View. Then, left-click and drag your automation point up or down between the points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/automation-curve-logic-pro.jpg"                      alt="automation curve logic pro"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Employ-the-Fade-Out-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Employ-the-Fade-Out-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Employ the Fade-Out Tool"></a>Method 2: Employ the Fade-Out Tool</h3><p>The fading-out process has additional option in Logic Pro. An audio track will fade out if the “Fade Out” slider is used. The audio will progressively fade away as a result. Then, to make an audio zone sound exactly like a “Crossfade-out” region, use the “Fade Out” slider. The fade tool offers an even simpler method for creating a fade out. However, keep in mind that this technique is limited to audio files and tracks. You’ll be able to see the cross-fade in action after you’ve applied it.</p><p>Step1 Navigate to the Tool Selector located at the Region View’s top.

Thankfully, you can use a <strong>Twitter video converter</strong> to convert Twitter to MP3 for offline playback on your audio player. And guess what? You don’t need special knowledge to edit and convert Twitter to MP3.</p><p>So in this post, we’ll learn how to convert a Twitter video to MP3 online or on your desktop. We’ll also discuss some primary reasons to <strong>download video Twitter to MP3</strong>. Let’s learn!</p><h3 id="Method-1-Download-Twitter-Video-as-MP3-File-with-Twitter-Video-Downloader-Online"><a href="#Method-1-Download-Twitter-Video-as-MP3-File-with-Twitter-Video-Downloader-Online" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Download Twitter Video as MP3 File with Twitter Video Downloader Online"></a>Method 1: Download Twitter Video as MP3 File with Twitter Video Downloader Online</h3><p>Let’s begin with the best online Twitter to MP3 converter, <a class="link"   href="https://www.keepvid.to/1-download-twitter-videos" >Keepvid.to <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a simple website that allows users to download high-quality videos and audio from 1,000+ websites. The MP3 downloader feature supports websites like Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, and more. It’s quick to use, taking around 10 to 15 seconds to download a 5-minute video. And best of all, you can convert Twitter to MP3 on your mobile browser.</p><p>Follow these quick steps to start converting the video into an MP3 file :</p><p>Step1 Open Keepvid.to Twitter Video Downloader, then copy-paste the Twitter video link on the field provided. Tap Go to begin loading your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-1.jpg"                      alt="keepvid twitter video converter load video"                ></p><p>Step2 After analyzing and loading the video, Keepvid will recommend multiple ways to extract the video contents. For the purposes of this post, head to the Audio Only section and choose MP3. You can also extract Twitter to OPUS, M4A, MP4, or 3GP.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-2.jpg"                      alt="keepvid twitter video converter download mp3"                ></p><p>Step3 Lastly, click Download to open the inbuilt audio player and extract the audio. You can also extract subtitles in .srt format. It’s that quick and easy!</p><p><strong>Limitations</strong>: It would be better if this Twitter to MP3 downloader would offer multiple MP3 output options. Only that!</p><h3 id="Method-2-Convert-Twitter-Video-to-MP3-with-an-Effective-Video-Editing-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Convert-Twitter-Video-to-MP3-with-an-Effective-Video-Editing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Convert Twitter Video to MP3 with an Effective Video-Editing Tool"></a>Method 2: Convert Twitter Video to MP3 with an Effective Video-Editing Tool</h3><p>After downloading your Twitter video, you might want to edit or merge it with other files before converting it to MP3 or any other format. For example, you might want to enhance the file with fun sound effects or chop off noisy or unwanted sections. Whichever the case, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be a good choice to edit and convert Twitter videos on your macOS or Windows PC.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>With this Hollywood-grade video editor, you can upload Twitter videos on the multitrack timeline before editing them accordingly. First, you can separate audio from Twitter video with a single click before trimming the audio, adjusting playback speed, extracting subtitles, muting, and adding sound effects. Excitingly, Filmora features 1,000+ royalty-free sound effects to customize your Twitter audio. After enough editing, save the file to MP3 or directly upload it on Vimeo or YouTube. You can even burn videos to DVD.</p><p>The step-by-step guide for converting Twitter video to MP3 with Filmora 11:</p><p>Step1 Create a video project and load the Twitter video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-3.jpg"                      alt="filmora twitter video converter upload video"                ></p><p>Install and run Filmora 11 on your computer and tap New Project. Then, tap the Import Media button to browse and upload your downloaded Twitter video. By the way, you can upload multiple Twitter videos before moving them to the storyboard.</p><p>Step2 Edit the Twitter video (optional).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora twitter video converter detach audio"                ></p><p>Do you want to retouch and customize your Twitter video before converting to MP3? Right-click the video track and then tap Detach Audio. Then, select the video track and delete it. After that, select the audio track and edit it professionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-5.jpg"                      alt="filmora twitter video converter edit audio"                ></p><p>For instance, place the timeline on the place to start trimming and click Split before deleting the unwanted clip. You can also retouch the playback speed by right-clicking the audio before choosing Show Speed Control. In addition, the Speech-to-Text tool can generate SRT subtitles.</p><p>Step3 Export the audio to MP3 format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-6.jpg"                      alt="filmora twitter video converter convert audio"                ></p><p>Are you happy with the edited audio? Preview it and continue editing if needed. If satisfied, tap Export and choose MP3 before naming your audio and selecting a destination path. You also adjust settings like encoder, channel, sample rate, and bit rate. Lastly, click Export to save the Twitter MP3 audio.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Download-Twitter-Videos-to-MP3-with-a-Browser-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Download-Twitter-Videos-to-MP3-with-a-Browser-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Download Twitter Videos to MP3 with a Browser Extension"></a>Method 3: Download Twitter Videos to MP3 with a Browser Extension</h3><p>Another convenient and straightforward way to download Twitter to MP3 is using the <a class="link"   href="https://x2twitter.com/en/extension/installed" >X2Twitter.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> browser extension. It’s a lightweight <strong>Twitter MP3 downloader</strong> for saving Twitter MP4 videos to MP3, MP4, and GIFs. This Chrome browser extension is free, and users don’t need to sign in anywhere to use it. But remember to reload the Twitter video tab after installing the extension for it to recognize your video. Also, be wary of the annoying adverts.</p><p>Let’s walk through the simple steps:</p><p>Step1 Install the X2Twitter.com extension on your Chrome browser.</p><p>Step2 After successfully adding this extension, open the Twitter video tab to click the blue Download button below the video. You’ll be redirected to X2Twitter.com.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-7.jpg"                      alt="x2twitter twitter video converter select video"                ></p><p>Step3 The browser will analyze the video and recommend multiple download options. You can download MP4, MP3, or JPG. Click Convert to MP3 and download the Twitter audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/twitter-video-converter-8.jpg"                      alt="x2twitter twitter video converter download video"                ></p><p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Although this method is quick and easy, the ads can be overwhelming. Also, if you’re not a fan of browser extensions, consider Keepvid.to.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is for informational and educational purposes only. We DO NOT endorse or encourage any kind of illegal activity.</p><p>The above section showed how to download Twitter to MP3 with online or offline tools. Now let’s have a look at what we can get after the downloading.</p><h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Saving-Video-Twitter-to-MP3"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Saving-Video-Twitter-to-MP3" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Saving Video Twitter to MP3"></a>The Benefits of Saving Video Twitter to MP3</h2><p>Converting a Twitter video to MP3 has immense benefits like offline playback, less mobile data usage, high-quality audio, and more. So, without wasting time, let’s discuss some reasons to convert <strong>Twitter video to MP3</strong>.</p><p><strong>1. Watch the video offline for free</strong></p><p>Are you always on the move with limited time to watch Twitter videos? Well, downloading a Twitter video to audio allows you to have an on-the-go music listening experience. As you may already know, you’ll need an internet connection to play Twitter videos, a luxury you may not always have. So get a Twitter video converter and play the audio offline for free.</p><p><strong>2. Gather sound effects</strong></p><p>You’ll know the benefits of adding sound effects to videos if you’re constantly editing videos on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and other social apps. Sound effects make videos more engaging by stimulating emotions, energy, and attention. And you know that finding free and quality sound effects can be challenging. For this reason, use a Twitter converter to extract sound effects from video.</p><p><strong>3. Extract famous movie quotes</strong></p><p>Twitter is an excellent platform for sharing movies. Some of these movie characters are known for their unique style that can motivate and influence their fans. Of course, this also includes music lyrics. With a Twitter video converter, you can easily extract famous movie quotes and share them with friends online. Besides audio, you can convert the quotes to text using a speech-to-text converter.</p><p><strong>4. Create an audiobook</strong></p><p>Many stories and cartoons are shared on Twitter that children will definitely find interesting. So, if you’re a fan of audiobooks, convert these Twitter videos to MP3 and upload them online. For example, you can find a video where the narrator is reading a book or their own story. Take advantage of this!</p><p><strong>5. Extract music from videos</strong></p><p>Listening to music on your smartphone or media player is more convenient than playing videos. The thing is that you can extract music from Twitter videos and create an offline mix. You can also use this music as your smartphone ringtone or share the music mix on social media and go viral.</p><p><strong>6. Improved loading speed</strong></p><p>Videos are obviously bigger than audio. As such, loading Twitter into your media player or online platform will need more resources, making the process slow. Remember that most video bandwidths are two or three times larger than audio bandwidths. So, to reduce the bandwidth and increase the loading speed, convert the Twitter video to MP3 audio.</p><p>Now that you have all the reasons to convert Twitter to MP3, let’s discuss the best Twitter MP3 downloader apps for online use. We’ll also review the best professional-grade Twitter video converter for Mac&#x2F;Windows PCs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>These are the best ways to download and convert Twitter to MP3. With the online options, you can quickly download Twitter to high-quality MP3 or MP4 before using Wondershare Filmora to edit and convert the Twitter file. So, go ahead and play your Twitter video offline with these download programs.

This article will show you how to take amazing reflective photographs with just your iPhone. Apple has really invested in improving the quality of it’s in-built lenses in their latest models of the iPhone. Much of the advertising now concerns the stunning photos it’s users can take. Historically this was reserved to those who had powerful SLR cameras. Of course they also want to compete with other manufacturers to be the phone that takes the best selfie!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-photography-for-iphone.jpg"                      alt="reflection-photography-for-iphone"                ></p><p> Reflective photography is an ever growing trend on social media, so you want your images to stand out… This handy guide tells you everything you need to know, and even how to create reflective photos in post production!</p><p> So let’s get snapping!</p><h2 id="Tips-For-Perfect-Reflective-Photography-With-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Tips-For-Perfect-Reflective-Photography-With-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Perfect Reflective Photography With Your iPhone"></a>Tips For Perfect Reflective Photography With Your iPhone</h2><h4 id="1-The-Surface"><a href="#1-The-Surface" class="headerlink" title="1.  The Surface"></a>1.  The Surface</h4><p> Of course the number one rule of reflective photography is that you have a reflective surface! It doesn’t have to be as simple as a mirror though, as the picture above shows lakes and pools are great if it is a clam weather day. You want to make sure that your surface is clean as far as possible to avoid distraction. If you wanted to be really creative you could find something like these:</p><p> A Well Polished Table</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-surface.jpg"                      alt="reflection-surface"                ></p><p> A Crystal&#x2F;Glass Ball</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crystal-ball.jpg"                      alt="reflection-photography-for-iPhone"                ></p><p> Water in a wine glass (turns everything upside down too!)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/water-reflection.jpg"                      alt="water-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition"><a href="#2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition" class="headerlink" title="2.  Pay Attention to Composition"></a>2.  Pay Attention to Composition</h4><p> Composition is the very basis of good photography, as the person taking the picture you decide the scene. The most integral part of good composition is the rule of thirds. This means you should divide up the scene&#x2F;subject into 9 equal squares&#x2F;rectangles (depending on frame).</p><p> You should put the subject or the most important parts of the scene into one or of the lines. Typically we have an impulse to put the subject straight in the middle of the shot, however placing the subject in othe of the other lines off to the side produces a far more engaging photo.</p><p> It is also really effective to have the subject where the gridlines intersect. This makes the image standout from others in social media feeds. It subconsciously pulls our attention.</p><p> iPhone already has a feature for you to bring up lines before you take the photo with the rule of thirds:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-composition-tips.jpg"                      alt="reflection-composition-tips"                ></p><p> To activate the lines simply go to <strong>Settings &gt; Camera and Photographs &gt; Grid</strong></p><h4 id="3-Keep-it-Simple"><a href="#3-Keep-it-Simple" class="headerlink" title="3.  Keep it Simple"></a>3.  Keep it Simple</h4><p> Reflective photography works best when the scene isn’t busy and there is nothing too distracting. Having one focus&#x2F;subject will produce a clean image and the reflection of the subject will be far more effective.</p><p> Reflective photography should convey a sense of calm, simplicity and tranquility. If the photograph has more than one pull of focus you’re likely to lose this.</p><p> Good</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keep-the-image-simple.jpg"                      alt="keep-the-image-simple"                ></p><p> Awful</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/awful-composition.jpg"                      alt="awful-composition"                ></p><h4 id="4-Reality-and-Reflection"><a href="#4-Reality-and-Reflection" class="headerlink" title="4.  Reality and Reflection"></a>4.  Reality and Reflection</h4><p> Don’t just focus on the reflection, these tend to distract from how good the reflection is. Of course if the reflective surface reflects too well and you just focus on that. The image might come out as looking the same as if you had just pointed and shot the subject.</p><p> You should have a mix of the physical real life subject and the reflection. This way you can demonstrate how effective reflective photography is. The iPhone is well equipped for this with the ability to take high quality photos of even moving subjects in bursts.</p><p> All you need to do is hold down the shutter&#x2F;take photo button and burst mode automatically takes lots of photos until you release.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reality-and-reflection.jpg"                      alt="reality-and-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="5-Texture"><a href="#5-Texture" class="headerlink" title="5.  Texture"></a>5.  Texture</h4><p> Using a still reflective surface is good, but reflective photos are more effective if you have been able to capture texture. Where the reflective surface distorts the real life subject, you’re able to artistically capture an entirely unique affect each time. This is why waves are a great way to create a truly different image with each shot.</p><p> It is also just good photography practice to have your subjects bend and distort the light. The contrasts make for an aesthetically beautiful image, and makes post production optimization even easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-use-of-texture.jpg"                      alt="make-use-of-texture"                ></p><h3 id="Post-Production-Reflective-Effects"><a href="#Post-Production-Reflective-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Post Production Reflective Effects"></a>Post Production Reflective Effects</h3><p> It’s possible to create great reflective photographs by using reflective effects after you have taken it. You can deceptively take one of your great photos and use the reflective effect to make it appear on a reflective looking surface. Here’s some examples of photos that were created using this effect through software:</p><p> The image of the lamp and the puddle were taken separately and meshed together using an app…</p><p> You can do this on iPhone using these apps:</p><table><thead><tr><th>App</th><th>Requirements</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reflect Mirror Camera</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflect-mirror-camera/id898143628?mt=8" >$2.99 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Reflection</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflection-create-water-reflection-photo-arts/id672111257?mt=8" >$2.99 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Photo Reflection</td><td>iOS 9.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-reflection/id484604482?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Photo Mirror Effects</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-mirror-effects-reflection-editor/id1019418266?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-Reflect-Mirror-Camera"><a href="#1-Reflect-Mirror-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Snapchat-Enhancement-The-Power-of-Spotlight-Feature"><a href="#Snapchat-Enhancement-The-Power-of-Spotlight-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Enhancement: The Power of Spotlight Feature"></a>Snapchat Enhancement: The Power of Spotlight Feature</h2><p>Snapchat is one of the most popular instant messaging apps. The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.</p><p>Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.</p><p>The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.</p><p>Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.</p><h2 id="What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences"></a>Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences</h3><p>When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let’s discuss those differences below:</p><p><strong>● Comments Sections</strong></p><p>While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.</p><p><strong>● Privacy Protection</strong></p><p>If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18. However, there’s an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.</p><h3 id="Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>It’s easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.</p><p><strong>Video Requirements</strong></p><p>The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:</p><ul><li>The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.</li><li>The video should be in portrait orientation.</li><li>The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.</li><li>The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.</li><li>There shouldn’t be any logo in the snap.</li><li>The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.</li></ul><p>If your snap doesn’t meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.</p><p><strong>Submission Terms</strong></p><p>There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.</p><p>While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Sexual acts</li><li>Harassment and bullying</li><li>Threats, violence, or harm</li><li>Illegal activities</li><li>Terrorism and hate speech</li></ul><p>You can go through the official <a class="link"   href="https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" >Snapchat community guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.</p><p>If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight. We will discuss them in the next section.</p><h3 id="How-to-Post-on-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Post-on-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Post on Spotlight?"></a>How to Post on Spotlight?</h3><p>There are multiple methods to submit a snap to Spotlight.

Then, here comes another important question: How to become a successful Snapchat creator?</p><p>Similar to TikTok and YouTube Shorts, there’s massive competition among creators on Snapchat. Both existing and new creators submit numerous snaps daily to get featured on Spotlight. So, how come you improve your chances of making it to Spotlight?</p><p>Well, the first thing you need to know is the algorithm that Snapchat Spotlight utilizes to show snaps to users. Secondly, there are some tips to help you build your Snapchat community. We’ll discuss both of them in the following sections.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview"></a>Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview</h3><p>Snapchat makes use of a specialized algorithm for Spotlight. The algorithm decides what snaps to show to a particular user based on their interests and other factors.</p><p>The following are the key factors that the Spotlight algorithm considers for showing users the most relevant and exciting snaps.</p><p><strong>Unique Views</strong></p><p>A unique view means a user viewed a snap at least once in a single session. If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.</p><p><strong>Total View Time</strong></p><p>It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.</p><p><strong>Number of Times the Video was Shared</strong></p><p>It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.</p><p><strong>Number of Screenshots</strong></p><p>This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.</p><h3 id="Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community"><a href="#Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community"></a>Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community</h3><p>Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.</p><p>Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche</strong></p><p>Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.</p><p><strong>Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools</strong></p><p>Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat’s native tools.</p><p><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></p><p>It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.</p><h2 id="A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey"><a href="#A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey" class="headerlink" title="A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey"></a>A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey</h2><p>Hopefully, you have known how to use Snapchat Spotlight and been ready to plan your creator life.
