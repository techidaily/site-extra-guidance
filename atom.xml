The push for digitalization of our everyday life has accumulated extra strength as it enables us to maintain physical distance with ease. Obviously, Facebook helped a great deal in popularizing the Metaverse by way of rebranding itself as Meta this year. Various other companies prioritized their embracing of the technology too including Microsoft, Epic Games, Minecraft, Roblox, and many others. Tech investors are also making a beeline for it because, as it is being noted, again and again, the processes of digitalization are not going to take a rollback.</p><p>But in the same breath observers have pointed out that the future of Metaverse is not going to be an exact extension of where the technology lies today. As some users have reported on social media, their experience in the Metaverse was cringe-worthy. Thanks to the lack of stringent regulations, the space is ripe for sexual and racial misconduct of the kind that violates our cherished values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-future.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Future"                ></p><p>Privacy is another issue that tech giants have to work on to assure users that their data is protected and is not being used by any entities whatsoever in an untoward way. Success on this matter stands on the highly volatile ground as a sense of loss of individual privacy at the hands of tech outfits is gaining wide currency. Despite the fact that millennials are turning away from social media in increasing numbers, as has been noted by a number of studies, one has to understand that such a blanket rejection comes at a great cost, one which the majority of people cannot possibly afford. As the future of work is now being predicted to rely heavily on Metaverse, one can possibly see why this is so. Thus the discourse turns again to the importance of regulation.</p><p>Two other frontiers that proponents of Metaverse must tackle are issues like the digital divide and environmental damage. Both these issues were resuscitated, again, thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic. Whereas the stakes are high in all these cases, this is not to say that the battle ends here. The perceived marriage between the technology of Metaverse and work, in general, has put on-table issues like class divide, racial discrimination, workplace exploitation, inept tax laws, and many things else.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, it is honest to admit that the future of Metaverse is still a highly speculative zone. The technology is new and packs immense potentialities in a number of different aspects. And this same inchoateness gives rise to apprehension along with a call for the tighter harnessing of the technology. Multiverse, on the other hand, is still mostly an erudite hypothetical concept, unlike Metaverse whose early renditions are already here for us to experience.</p><p>Hope lies in the fact that the formation of the Metaverse vs. Multiverse discourse has helped in clarifying the latter concept. Pop culture renditions, the kind we find in the latest Spiderman offering, Spiderman: No Way Home, or in the widely-acclaimed Richard Linklater film Slacker are also contributing in that direction. With the breath-taking pace that technology is evolving, one can be optimistic that both these concepts will move beyond this conflictual relationship and open themselves up to us to enjoy them on their own terms.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There is no denying the fact that the lure of an embodied virtual existence has monopolized our imagination in recent years like never before.

With the breath-taking pace that technology is evolving, one can be optimistic that both these concepts will move beyond this conflictual relationship and open themselves up to us to enjoy them on their own terms.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/list-of-affordable-licensed-game-music-websites-for-2024/"><u>List of Affordable, Licensed Game Music Websites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-perfecting-visual-output-integrating-luts-into-ae-projects/"><u>[Updated] Perfecting Visual Output  Integrating LUTs Into AE Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-pushing-the-envelope-in-display-technology-detailed-examination-of-benq-bl2711u/"><u>[New] Pushing the Envelope in Display Technology  Detailed Examination of BenQ BL2711U</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reimagining-action-recording-with-intova-edge-x/"><u>2024 Approved  Reimagining Action Recording with Intova Edge X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-meme-madness-the-iphone-edition/"><u>[Updated] Meme Madness  The iPhone Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/proficient-use-of-audacity-for-high-quality-recordings-for-2024/"><u>Proficient Use of Audacity for High-Quality Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-4-photo-and-video-slideshow-maker-for-macos-sierra/"><u>2024 Approved  4 Photo and Video Slideshow Maker for macOS Sierra</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-latest-pro-cams-for-full-spheres/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the Latest Pro Cams for Full Spheres</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-world-of-gopro-filming/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the World of GoPro Filming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-pioneering-strategies-for-success-in-the-spotify-ad-arena/"><u>In 2024, Pioneering Strategies for Success in the Spotify Ad Arena</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-android-lock-screen-using-emergency-call-on-oneplus-12-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On OnePlus 12?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-vivo-y55s-5g-2023-screen-not-working-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Resolve Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) Screen Not Working | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/maximizing-drone-efficiency-with-premium-lipo-units/"><u>Maximizing Drone Efficiency with Premium LiPo Units</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-slow-motion-innovation-with-sony-sandq-feature/"><u>Updated Slow-Motion Innovation with Sony S&Q Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-deleted-honor-magic-6-pro-photos-an-easy-method-explained-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/"><u>How to Restore Deleted Honor Magic 6 Pro Photos  An Easy Method Explained.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/set-your-preferred-job-location-on-linkedin-app-of-your-apple-iphone-se-2022-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Set Your Preferred Job Location on LinkedIn App of your Apple iPhone SE (2022) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/discords-no-1-love-finding-groups-for-2024/"><u>Discord's No. 1 Love Finding Groups for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-instagram-influencer-blueprint-from-few-to-a-thousand-fans-for-2024/"><u>The Instagram Influencer Blueprint  From Few to a Thousand Fans for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-virtual-board-functions-across-zoom-devices-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Virtual Board Functions Across Zoom Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-video-metadata-made-simple-8-top-rated-mac-editor-tools/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Video Metadata Made Simple 8 Top-Rated Mac Editor Tools</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $7 2TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money.

Best price of unlimited cloud storage service</h3><p>For the best <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> for unlimited storage, here is a list of a few recommended cloud storage services.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-3.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>The service offers one of the industry’s most excellent versioning systems, broad file-sharing functionality, outstanding security, and privacy.</p><p>Sync.com offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>Teams Standard Plan for 1TB of storage space costs $6 per month, billed annually</li><li>Teams Unlimited Plan for Unlimited storage space costs $15 per month, billed annually.</li><li>Enterprise plan – Custom pricing</li></ul><p><em><strong># Dropbox</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-4.JPG"                      alt="dropbox"                ></p><p>It established numerous file-sharing and syncing trends currently refined.

Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><em><strong># Google Drive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free" class="headerlink" title="2.

Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

Dropbox first used the sync-folder model, and this version is among the finest.</p><p>Dropbox offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>The Dropbox Plus plan for 2TB of storage space costs $10 monthly</li><li>The Dropbox Family Plan for 2TB storage space costs $17 monthly</li></ul><h3 id="3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service-1"><a href="#3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><em><strong># Google Drive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

TeraBox also guarantees ISO&#x2F;IEC-certified cloud security and offers “Locked Box” functionality for private cloud storage.</p><h3 id="3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest-1"><a href="#3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?"></a>3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-the-Landscape-SMM-Best-Practices"><a href="#Navigating-the-Landscape-SMM-Best-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Navigating the Landscape: SMM Best Practices"></a>Navigating the Landscape: SMM Best Practices</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.</p><p><strong>10.

They’re also easy to mount on almost any surface i-e., mounting onto your bike helmet makes it easy to capture every moment on your ride, so that it doesn’t matter where you are, you’ll be able to capture what’s happening around you.</p><p>GoPro time-lapse is a way to view the world from your camera’s point of view. It allows you to see everything that happened in a short period, either as it happens or over several days. You can use GoPro time-lapse to make videos about your daily life, or even about events like weddings, and vacations. You can use GoPro time-lapse for a more serious purpose.</p><p>There are many different cameras available on the market today that will work with GoPro time-lapse. Time-lapse videos are filmed at a constant speed and then edited together to create a video that shows the passage of time in real-time. In this blog post, we’ll explore why GoPro time-lapse is important, and how it can help you capture your memories.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode"></a>Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode</h2><p>GoPro time-lapse video mode allows you to create a video that shows the passage of time over a period of days or weeks. The video is created by taking photos at regular intervals and then editing them together so that they appear to run in real-time. One of the most popular uses of GoPro time-lapse videos is when you want to capture something in motion.</p><p>You can use this technique for many different types of subjects including landscapes, cars, people, and animals and you can even add sounds like birds chirping or waves crashing along with them! It’s also possible to make this type of video if you’re using any other camera brand than GoPro itself. This method produces high-quality videos that can be used as promotional material.</p><p>The GoPro time-lapse creates the final video by stitching together the individual still images into one long clip. The software also allows you to manipulate each frame individually, which can be used to adjust the focus and exposure settings of your shot. GoPro Time-lapse videos are videos that show a sequence of events over a substantial period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-timelapse-video-mode.jpg"                      alt="gopro timelapse video mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro"></a>Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro</h2><p>If you’re a videographer or photographer, you’ve probably considered shooting time-lapse videos. They’re great for showing the passage of time, but they can also be used to show the beauty of a place. With GoPro cameras, you can create a time-lapse video in just minutes. Here’s how to shoot your time-lapse video with GoPro.</p><h5 id="Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode"><a href="#Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Choose your shooting mode"></a>Step1 Choose your shooting mode</h5><p>Firstly, choose the shooting mode, that is which kind of mode you want. If you want to shoot a time-lapse video then first click on the mode button and select the video mode. The video mode will be shown on the front screen after pressing it.</p><h5 id="Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode"><a href="#Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select the time-lapse mode"></a>Step2 Select the time-lapse mode</h5><p>Press the set-up button and go to the video settings which are held on the left side. After that click on the time-lapse video. There are many features and options in HERO8. There is a night lapse option in GoPro which is normally used in night photography. We can use this feature when there is limited lighting. The time-lapse mode was used in earlier models.</p><h5 id="Step3-Change-the-interval-settings"><a href="#Step3-Change-the-interval-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change the interval settings"></a>Step3 Change the interval settings</h5><p>Choosing the correct interval settings is essential to creating a professional-looking time-lapse video. The interval time is the amount of time between each frame in your video. 30 FPS is used by GoPro time-lapse which means 30 pictures are required for a one-second video. The first step to shooting a GoPro time-lapse video is choosing the interval settings.</p><p>This can be done through GoPro’s settings menu, which can be accessed by tapping the icon in the upper right corner of the main screen, then tapping “Settings” in the menu that appears. the camera will take pictures every few seconds while recording video, which is great if you’re trying to hit a certain number of frames per second (FPS).</p><h5 id="Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button"><a href="#Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button"></a>Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button</h5><p>If you want to shoot time-lapse videos on a GoPro, first you’ll need to mount your camera. Then press the shutter button on your camera and start shooting. Attach the camera to the tripod with the adhesive mount provided. Set up your camera by adjusting the settings for exposure, ISO, and other options in the Settings menu (you can find these settings in the Settings tab)</p><p>You’ll probably want to use a wide-angle lens for this kind of video because you’ll want to capture as much of your surroundings as possible. If you want to change the length of time you want to shoot, press the button again until it says “Time Lapse” or whatever setting you want.</p><h5 id="Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting"><a href="#Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting"></a>Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting</h5><p>When you are done with your shooting press the shutter button to end the shooting. GoPro will automatically combine all your clicked photos in a single video. You don’t need to do anything to combine the photos. The best part about this camera is that you can use it to shoot both vertical and horizontal time-lapses, as well as time-lapse photos.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer</h2><p>Editing time-lapse videos can be a bit tricky, but with the right tools and a little bit of practice, you can create some stunning time-lapse videos that will amaze your friends and family.

Filmora is one of the professional tools for editing photos and videos.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/seamless-shifts-revitalizing-vhs-graphics-with-computer-magic-for-2024/"><u>Seamless Shifts  Revitalizing VHS Graphics with Computer Magic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-leveraging-social-proof-for-effective-fb-giving-initiatives/"><u>[Updated] Leveraging Social Proof for Effective FB Giving Initiatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-pushing-limits-with-4k-vision-lgs-monitor-the-31mu97-b/"><u>[New] Pushing Limits with 4K Vision – LG's Monitor, the 31MU97-B</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leading-caller-id-changers-with-magical-features/"><u>2024 Approved  Leading Caller ID Changers with Magical Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-iphones-vr-video-viewing/"><u>In 2024, Mastering iPhone's VR Video Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-instagrams-video-reversal-quirk/"><u>[Updated] Navigating Instagram's Video Reversal Quirk</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/leading-edge-slow-motion-camera-technology-mobile-devices-for-2024/"><u>Leading Edge Slow Motion Camera Technology, Mobile Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/15-best-strongest-pokemon-to-use-in-pokemon-go-pvp-leagues-for-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>15 Best Strongest Pokémon To Use in Pokémon GO PvP Leagues For Oppo A18 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/beatniks-guide-to-music-enhanced-snapchats/"><u>Beatniks' Guide to Music-Enhanced Snapchats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-enabling-cross-platform-play-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[Updated] Enabling Cross-Platform Play  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-mobile-editing-apps-for-dji-videos/"><u>In 2024, Best Mobile Editing Apps for DJI Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/2024-approved-2023s-premier-free-sound-engineering-tools-the-ultimate-top-10-list/"><u>2024 Approved 2023S Premier Free Sound Engineering Tools The Ultimate Top 10 List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-lenovo-thinkphone-to-laptop-without-usb-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Lenovo ThinkPhone to Laptop Without USB | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/writing-for-impact-a-compreenas-guide-to-youtube-video-storytelling-for-2024/"><u>Writing for Impact  A Compreenas Guide to YouTube Video Storytelling for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplified-guide-to-saving-instagrams-dynamic-content/"><u>In 2024, Simplified Guide to Saving Instagram's Dynamic Content</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, not many people know what the term means. In addition, identifying sources for public domain art can be challenging if you are unaware of what these creative works entail.</p><p>Here is a full overview of public domain art, including how to find royalty-free art for your creations. Furthermore, you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning royalty-free art.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">what are public domain arts</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">What is the copyright policy of famous art in history</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Can you use them for free</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Public Domain Pictures</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Wikimedia Commons</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">The New York Public Library Digital Collections</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Flickr Commons</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Artvee.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Museo</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork"><a href="#Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?"></a>Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?</h2><p>Did you know that not all items you find on the internet are public domain? For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="1. Public Domain Pictures"></a>1. Public Domain Pictures</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-1.jpg"                      alt="public domain pictures"                ></p><p>Publicdomainpictures.net is a collection of thousands of photos and videos across all genres. In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons" class="headerlink" title="2. Wikimedia Commons"></a>2. Wikimedia Commons</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-2.jpg"                      alt="wikimedia commons"                ></p><p>Wikimedia Commons is arguably the largest public domain image library available. It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections" class="headerlink" title="3. The New York Public Library Digital Collections"></a>3.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons" class="headerlink" title="4. Flickr Commons"></a>4. Flickr Commons</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-4.jpg"                      alt="flickr commons"                ></p><p>Initially, Flickr only featured images from a selection of verified contributors. However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date. Alternatively, you can find public domain content by visiting the Public Domain group URL.</p><h2 id="Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine"><a href="#Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine"></a>Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</h2><p>Although Google search is the most popular resource for royalty-free art, there are specific public domain art search engines to help you find exactly what you need. Here are a few of them to consider.</p><h3 id="1-Artvee-com"><a href="#1-Artvee-com" class="headerlink" title="1. Artvee.com"></a>1. Artvee.com</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-5.jpg"                      alt="artvee com"                ></p><p>Artvee.com is a public domain art search engine that specializes in classical art. The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo"><a href="#2-Museo" class="headerlink" title="2. Museo"></a>2. Museo</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-6.jpg"                      alt="museo"                ></p><p>Another public domain art search engine to consider is Museo.app. It is an open-source web interface that allows you to find royalty-free art from different museums. Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes. Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it. Furthermore, it does not include any usage restrictions.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><ul><li><a href="#part2-1">Public Domain Pictures</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Wikimedia Commons</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">The New York Public Library Digital Collections</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Flickr Commons</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Artvee.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Museo</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork-1"><a href="#Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork-1" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?"></a>Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?</h2><p>Did you know that not all items you find on the internet are public domain?

It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons-1"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date. Alternatively, you can find public domain content by visiting the Public Domain group URL.</p><h2 id="Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine-1"><a href="#Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine-1" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine"></a>Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</h2><p>Although Google search is the most popular resource for royalty-free art, there are specific public domain art search engines to help you find exactly what you need. Here are a few of them to consider.</p><h3 id="1-Artvee-com-1"><a href="#1-Artvee-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Artvee.com"></a>1. Artvee.com</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-5.jpg"                      alt="artvee com"                ></p><p>Artvee.com is a public domain art search engine that specializes in classical art. The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo-1"><a href="#2-Museo-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Museo"></a>2. Museo</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/public-domain-art-6.jpg"                      alt="museo"                ></p><p>Another public domain art search engine to consider is Museo.app. It is an open-source web interface that allows you to find royalty-free art from different museums. Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><h2 id="FAQ-1"><a href="#FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes. Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it. Furthermore, it does not include any usage restrictions.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular

People like me who work as freelancers or in different companies now use Zoom for numerous work calls and daily virtual meets. It doesn’t matter if you have a laptop or a smartphone you can put Zoom to use anytime.</p><p>So if you have a query, “is Zoom in android actually a thing?” and if you are new to Zoom, don’t know how to start or join a Zoom meeting on Android, and how to schedule it, this step-wise process will help you out. So before making that Zoom call, here is everything you must understand and be aware of:</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Join Zoom meetings using a Zoom ID on Android</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Schedule a Zoom Meeting Android</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here’s how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:</p><ul><li>On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option “<strong>New Meeting.</strong>“</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg"                      alt="new zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for the selection of “<strong>Start a Meeting.</strong>“ Once done, you will notice a video conference space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg"                      alt="start a zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, you will see a pop-up with the “<strong>Got it</strong>“ button on it. Click on it so you can provide a permit to Zoom to access the microphone and camera of the device you are using.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-3.jpg"                      alt="zoom access permission android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you will see a window pop-up asking you to provide access to Zoom to record a video or click a picture. Click on the button “<strong>Allow</strong>“</li><li>Now, at this point, the screen of your device will have the option “<strong>Participants,</strong>“. This option you can opt to use for the addition of one or more people to your meeting.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-4.jpg"                      alt="allow more participants"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for clicking on “<strong>Invite</strong>“. Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom’s contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on. So it’s pretty simple to use in that sense.</li><li>Now, you have to press “<strong>Send Email</strong>“ by putting everyone’s email address and now, click on the “<strong>Send</strong>“ button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-5.jpg"                      alt="send email zoom meeting"                ></p><p>Also, when it comes to copying the meeting’s hyperlink, you can opt to tap on the “<strong>Copy invite link</strong>“ option on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Join an existing Zoom Meeting on Android</h2><p>So if you have downloaded the Zoom app, made an account, and have to join a meeting on Zoom on Android TV or phone that’s already in process, you can do it with the help of the Zoom URL or Zoom ID. This is if someone else is probably hosting it this time. It’s not difficult to do so and here’s how you can opt for a Zoom android TV or&#x2F;and phone virtual meet-up:</p><h3 id="Join-Zoom-meeting-using-the-Zoom-URL-on-Android"><a href="#Join-Zoom-meeting-using-the-Zoom-URL-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android"></a>Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android</h3><ul><li>Opt for clicking the meeting link that you have gotten in your email or wherever else.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-6.jpg"                      alt="click zoom meeting link"                ></p><ul><li>You will see a window pop-up on the Zoom app. It will show waiting for the Zoom meeting to be started by the host.</li><li>At this point, you will notice a window pop-up asking you to provide access to the camera along with the microphone on your device.

Because many smartphones nowadays offer the best picture quality when it comes to snapping photos using their camera, it is imperative to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> so the main subject grabs the limelight, hence making the other objects in the background get the least focus.</p><p>That said, when it is said <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>, it practically means that you are learning the process of blurring the background so the main subject (a person or an object) gets the most attention, and that’s what is explained in the following sections.</p><p>There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones. Likewise, if you already have an image, you can use the Photos app’s built-in effects, or download a third-party program to get the job done. Some of the common methods in this context are described below.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Take a Photo with a Blurred Background</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Add Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone"></a>Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</h2><p>Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models. However, if you are using iPhone SE 2020 or iPhone XR, you can blur the background of the images only with the people as the main subject.</p><p>You can learn <strong>how to blur an image on iPhone</strong> using Portrait mode by following the instructions given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch the Camera App</strong></p><p>Grab your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustration), and tab the <strong>Camera</strong> icon from the Home screen to launch the app.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Get to the Portrait Mode and Adjust the Depth</strong></p><p>Swipe-drag the modes present above the <strong>Shutter</strong> button to switch to the <strong>PORTRAIT</strong> option, and tap the main subject on the screen that you want to capture the image of. Next, tap the <strong>f</strong> (<strong>Depth</strong>) icon from the top-right corner, and drag the <strong>Depth</strong> slider to the left to increase the intensity of the blur effect of the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-portrait-mode-blur-background.jpg"                      alt="iphone portrait mode blur background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Capture and Access the Photo</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Capture</strong> icon from the bottom-center to capture the image. To access, you can either tap the <strong>Preview</strong> icon from the bottom-left corner, or get to the <strong>Photos</strong> app from the Home screen, go to <strong>Albums</strong>, and access the captured photo from the <strong>Recents</strong> album.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-photo-background-iphone-portrait-mode.jpg"                      alt="blur photo background iphone portrait mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Take-a-Photo-with-a-Blurred-Background-on-Older-iPhones-by-Getting-Closer-to-the-Subject"><a href="#Part-2-Take-a-Photo-with-a-Blurred-Background-on-Older-iPhones-by-Getting-Closer-to-the-Subject" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject"></a>Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject</h2><p>If you are using an older model of iPhone that doesn’t have ‘Portrait’ mode, you can still capture the images with the blurred background by getting closer to the subject, and enabling ‘Auto Focus’ before tapping the ‘Capture’ button. You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Camera App</strong></p><p>Use the method explained above to launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone. Because it’s an old model that doesn’t have Portrait mode, you can stay in the <strong>PHOTO</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Turn on Auto Focus</strong></p><p>Tap and hold the main subject on the screen until the <strong>AE&#x2F;AF Lock</strong> message shows up at the top to confirm that the <strong>Auto Focus</strong> feature has been turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-auto-focus-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="iphone auto focus blur photo background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Capture and Access the Image</strong></p><p>Get closer to the subject. Ensure that the background around the main subject gets blurry and you move forward. Tap the <strong>Capture</strong> icon once you are close enough to get the desired level of blurriness in the background. Now, use the method explained above to access the captured photo.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Adding-Vignette-Effect-to-Photo-to-Blur-the-Background-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Adding-Vignette-Effect-to-Photo-to-Blur-the-Background-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Adding Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background on iPhone"></a>Part 3: Adding Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background on iPhone</h2><p>The built-in Photos app comes with the Vignette effect that can be applied to the image at the time of editing. However, to get this done, it is recommended that the main subject should be at the center so the background looks unimportant. You can follow the steps given below to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> with the Vignette effect:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Photo’s Edit Mode</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>Photos</strong> app on your iPhone, go to the album with the target photo, and tap to open the target photo. Next, make sure that the picture is not open in the full-screen mode, and tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the top-right corner to get to the <strong>Edit</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply and Adjust the Vignette Effect</strong></p><p>Tap the Effects icon from the bottom, swipe left to horizontally scroll through the available effects to get to <strong>VIGNETTE</strong>, and use the slider under it to manage the intensity to <strong>blur picture iPhone</strong> has.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-picture-on-iphone-with-vignette-effect.jpg"                      alt="blur picture on iphone with vignette effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Save and Access the Photo</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>Done</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the changes and to exit the <strong>Edit</strong> mode. Continue using the image as and&#x2F;or where needed.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps"><a href="#Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps"></a>Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</h2><p>You may want to use a third-party app to apply effects to the photos because they offer several advanced features that the iPhone’s built-in Photos app doesn’t. Furthermore, since such programs are designed specifically for the purpose, they are quite intuitive and come with self-explanatory options and buttons.</p><p>There is a plethora of apps available on the App Store that can help you get the job done, and most of them come with their free tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>. One such program is Snapseed that offers an easy way to pick the main subject in the image, and blur all the background objects behind it. The process of blurring the picture with Snapseed is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add the Target Photo to Snapseed</strong></p><p>After <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619" >installing Snapseed from the App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, launch the program, and tap anywhere on the main screen. On the accessibility allowance box, tap <strong>Select Photos</strong>, tap to select the target photo from your iPhone, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner. Next, tap anywhere on the screen to import the selected picture to Snapseed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-photo-to-blur-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="open photo to blur snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick the Blur Tool</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>TOOLS</strong> from the bottom of the interface, and from the options available in the box that pops up, tap <strong>Lens Blur</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pick-blur-tool-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="pick blur tool snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Blur Shape and Size</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Shape</strong> icon from the bottom to switch between the <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Elliptical</strong> blur shapes. Tap the Blue dot at the center of the image, and drag it to the main subject in the photo. Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export</strong></p><p>From the top, ensure that the <strong>Blur Strength</strong> option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose <strong>Vignette Strength</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapseed-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="snapseed blur photo background"                ></p><p>Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the <strong>OK</strong> button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-blurred-photo-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="save blurred photo snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong>.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Take a Photo with a Blurred Background</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Add Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone"></a>Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</h2><p>Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models.

You can follow the steps given below to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> with the Vignette effect:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Photo’s Edit Mode</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>Photos</strong> app on your iPhone, go to the album with the target photo, and tap to open the target photo. Next, make sure that the picture is not open in the full-screen mode, and tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the top-right corner to get to the <strong>Edit</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply and Adjust the Vignette Effect</strong></p><p>Tap the Effects icon from the bottom, swipe left to horizontally scroll through the available effects to get to <strong>VIGNETTE</strong>, and use the slider under it to manage the intensity to <strong>blur picture iPhone</strong> has.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-picture-on-iphone-with-vignette-effect.jpg"                      alt="blur picture on iphone with vignette effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Save and Access the Photo</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>Done</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the changes and to exit the <strong>Edit</strong> mode. Continue using the image as and&#x2F;or where needed.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps-3"><a href="#Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps"></a>Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</h2><p>You may want to use a third-party app to apply effects to the photos because they offer several advanced features that the iPhone’s built-in Photos app doesn’t. Furthermore, since such programs are designed specifically for the purpose, they are quite intuitive and come with self-explanatory options and buttons.</p><p>There is a plethora of apps available on the App Store that can help you get the job done, and most of them come with their free tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>. One such program is Snapseed that offers an easy way to pick the main subject in the image, and blur all the background objects behind it. The process of blurring the picture with Snapseed is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add the Target Photo to Snapseed</strong></p><p>After <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619" >installing Snapseed from the App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, launch the program, and tap anywhere on the main screen. On the accessibility allowance box, tap <strong>Select Photos</strong>, tap to select the target photo from your iPhone, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner. Next, tap anywhere on the screen to import the selected picture to Snapseed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-photo-to-blur-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="open photo to blur snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick the Blur Tool</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>TOOLS</strong> from the bottom of the interface, and from the options available in the box that pops up, tap <strong>Lens Blur</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pick-blur-tool-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="pick blur tool snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Blur Shape and Size</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Shape</strong> icon from the bottom to switch between the <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Elliptical</strong> blur shapes. Tap the Blue dot at the center of the image, and drag it to the main subject in the photo. Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export</strong></p><p>From the top, ensure that the <strong>Blur Strength</strong> option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose <strong>Vignette Strength</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapseed-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="snapseed blur photo background"                ></p><p>Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the <strong>OK</strong> button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-blurred-photo-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="save blurred photo snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong>.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-masterful-voice-changes-without-cost-explore-these-options/"><u>[Updated] Masterful Voice Changes Without Cost - Explore These Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-master-voice-customization-on-ps-playstation-devices/"><u>In 2024, Master Voice Customization on PS PlayStation Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-starting-with-a-gopro-essential-upgrades-for-new-filmmakers/"><u>In 2024, Starting with a GoPro  Essential Upgrades for New Filmmakers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/perfecting-audio-records-with-our-step-by-step-guide-for-2024/"><u>Perfecting Audio Records with Our Step-by-Step Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-masterclass-in-kinemaster-application-and-top-tier-opponents-online/"><u>[Updated] Masterclass in KineMaster Application & Top-Tier Opponents Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-safest-and-cutest-toy-drones-for-children/"><u>In 2024, Safest and Cutest Toy Drones for Children</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-recording-wizardry-5-tactics-for-windows-enthusiasts/"><u>2024 Approved  Recording Wizardry  5 Tactics for Windows Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-navigate-through-prime-virtual-bike-selections/"><u>[Updated] Navigate Through Prime Virtual Bike Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-pushing-boundaries-the-future-of-filmmaking-in-4k-with-yi/"><u>In 2024, Pushing Boundaries  The Future of Filmmaking in 4K With Yi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-craft-unforgettable-experiences-for-more-subscribers-with-these-6-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Craft Unforgettable Experiences for More Subscribers with These 6 Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-digital-dollars-earn-from-youtubers-in-8-ways-for-2024/"><u>[New] Digital Dollars  Earn From YouTubers in 8 Ways for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-pro-tools-pro-results-elevating-video-quality-in-youtube-editing/"><u>[Updated] Pro Tools, Pro Results  Elevating Video Quality in YouTube Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-fake-android-location-without-rooting-for-your-itel-a60-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Fake Android Location without Rooting For Your Itel A60 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfecting-switch-pro-techniques-on-steam-platform/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfecting Switch Pro Techniques on Steam Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-oneplus-ace-2v-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 2V to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/gmail-not-working-on-nubia-z50s-pro-7-common-problems-and-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Gmail Not Working on Nubia Z50S Pro 7 Common Problems & Fixes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/beginners-guide-how-to-create-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money-for-2024/"><u>Beginners’ Guide  How To Create a YouTube Channel and Make Money for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/silent-streams-cutting-the-chatter-of-video-audio-tracks/"><u>Silent Streams Cutting the Chatter of Video Audio Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-10-ipad-slideshow-apps-to-create-a-slideshow/"><u>2024 Approved Top 10 iPad Slideshow Apps to Create a Slideshow</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-In-Video-Narrations-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Mastering-In-Video-Narrations-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Mastering In-Video Narrations: A Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Mastering In-Video Narrations: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Ah, the infamous voiceover. Some filmmakers hate it – considering it a lazy method of telling a story. But it’s actually quite helpful to understand when, and how to include voiceovers and narrations in your video project.</p><p>And when you learn how to use this technique the right way, your YouTube videos will become more engaging and your watch time will shoot up.</p><p>I’ll be demonstrating how to add voiceovers and narrations in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to help you step up your video creation game.</p><h2 id="Voiceover-or-Narration"><a href="#Voiceover-or-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Voiceover or Narration?"></a>Voiceover or Narration?</h2><p>But first, what’s the difference between a voiceover and a narration? Truth be told, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two.</p><p>Typically, a voiceover is a technique used to impart some new information in a concise way, but narration generally conveys a storytelling aspect.</p><p>A voiceover is when the subject speaks but the screen has cut away from the person on screen. So the dialog is from a clear speaker, but the visuals have cut away to b-roll or other visual elements like a title slide.</p><p>On the other hand, a narration could be a different character speaking or an independent narrator as you would find in a novel.</p><p>From the layperson’s perspective, there is not much difference. In both situations, you are adding an audio-only track to your video project timeline.</p><p>The difference is more in terms of HOW you have chosen to tell your story on screen. It’s more of a stylistic distinction than anything else.</p><p>For the purpose of this article, I will be using the term “voiceover and “narration” interchangeably since they are both done the same way.</p><p>But here’s the good news: the way you add either option is the same in Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png"                      alt="add either option"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-add-narration"><a href="#How-to-add-narration" class="headerlink" title="How to add narration"></a>How to add narration</h2><p>So the easiest way to add narration is directly to a project. The benefit of this is that you can record your narration inside Filmora while you watch the preview of your edited video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-09.png"                      alt="add narration to project"                ></p><p>A good example of this would be narrating a story on top of some still images and video clips from a recent vacation. (In most cases you would want to turn off the sound of the video clip, or at least use ducking to help the viewer focus on the narration.)</p><p>You put the playhead where you want to start recording and hit the microphone icon under the preview window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-08.png"                      alt="hit microphone icon"                ></p><p>A 3-second countdown will pop up and start recording immediately after this countdown.</p><p>You can record your narration and click stop.</p><p>After recording, you can trim and edit your narration, you can delete it and record it again, and can move it and edit it like any other feature.</p><h2 id="Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration"><a href="#Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Some Tips for Recording Narration"></a>Some Tips for Recording Narration</h2><p>Try playing the clip in the preview window to get a sense of what you want to say fits well with the space available in the project.</p><p>Know what you want to tell your viewer rather than speak aimlessly. What can you do if your narration is too long?</p><p>You can edit pauses or weak parts out of the voiceover to trim it up. But if it is still too long, you can easily add another video clip, or even still images to help boost the length to match your narration.</p><p>Fortunately, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with video b-roll which is another great option. When using b-roll, it’s better to use multiple shorter clips than one longer clip in most cases. But adding the same b-roll clip near the beginning and another section of the same b-roll clip, later on, should help you match the length of your narration to the video timeline.</p><h2 id="Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device"><a href="#Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device" class="headerlink" title="Narration is a great storytelling device"></a>Narration is a great storytelling device</h2><p>Narration is a fantastic tool to have in your arsenal as a young filmmaker. It allows you to quickly communicate feelings, backstory, and context quickly and effectively.</p><p>Practice adding it to your videos to see how it adds depth and dimension to your videos.</p><p>It can also help make a connection with your audience because you can be relating to the images on the screen as they watch them. This is effective in building your YouTube audience.</p><h2 id="Always-use-a-good-mic"><a href="#Always-use-a-good-mic" class="headerlink" title="Always use a good mic"></a>Always use a good mic</h2><p>When adding voiceover or narration to your project, be sure to use a good USB microphone. A good quality sound will elevate your entire project and just requires a little planning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-good-microphone.jpg"                      alt="use good microphone"                ></p><p>Also, be sure to check that your external microphone is selected when you start recording. There’s nothing worse than nailing the perfect narration and realizing it was recorded with the built-in mic, not your USB microphone.</p><h2 id="Should-you-use-narration-in-your-next-project"><a href="#Should-you-use-narration-in-your-next-project" class="headerlink" title="Should you use narration in your next project?"></a>Should you use narration in your next project?</h2><p>The best way to learn something is by doing it. So the next time you record a video, think about how you could augment your video project with narration.</p><p>You might feel a little odd recording a voiceover for the first time, but it allows you to communicate a lot of information quickly and clarify what might overwise be obscure – and good video is all about communicating your POV clearly and with brevity.</p><p>Filmora makes it easy to add narration of voice-overs to your video projects.

Are you a vlogger clueless about how to independently shoot videos and do things simultaneously? Or maybe you’re just a photogenic person who’s hands are tired of holding out phones for the perfect selfie.</p><p>We are halfway past 2020, and it’s time we put technology to good use and shoo away our filmmaking&#x2F; photography problems. Let us introduce to you the solution – auto-tracking camera mounts that follow you around and automatically shoot whatever you want.</p><p>Who said flying solo is a challenge for artists? Focus all your creativity on creating content and letting one of these auto-follow camera mounts take care of the technical part for you.</p><h2 id="Top-5-Auto-Tracking-Camera-Mounts-2020"><a href="#Top-5-Auto-Tracking-Camera-Mounts-2020" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Auto Tracking Camera Mounts 2020"></a>Top 5 Auto Tracking Camera Mounts 2020</h2><p>Let’s take a look at the top auto-tracking camera mounts you can buy in 2020.</p><h3 id="1-PicBot"><a href="#1-PicBot" class="headerlink" title="1.

With this mount, in one click, or no clicks at all, you can become a professional visual content creator.</p><p>When PicBot offers the features of clicking extensive panoramas, it comes equipped with an object tracking flexible enough for it. This auto-follow camera mount can turn a full circle when capturing videos and a complete left to right when capturing panoramic shots. This auto-tracking feature, however, is limited to <strong>face tracking</strong> and cannot follow inanimate objects.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>App Loaded With Features<br>Timelapses and panoramas have never been as easy. With loaded features that work completely automatically, you can have your bot capture stunning visuals swiveling around the entire circumference of your landscape and being a steady cameraman for even the longest of time-lapses.</li><li>Bluetooth 4.0 Control</li></ul><p>For complete orientation, start-stop, and focus control, PicBot is equipped with a manually operated Bluetooth remote.</p><ul><li>Automatic Still Countdown</li></ul><p>When you want to capture yourself sitting back and relaxing, PicBot offers you the option to do that without even pressing a single button. The motion detectors will detect when you’re still for a few seconds and the automatic still countdown will begin, capturing the perfect photo at the end.</p><p><strong>Supported Devices:</strong></p><p>Compatible only with the latest smartphones – Android 4.3 &amp; above and iOS 7 &amp; above. The optimal weight that this bot can handle is 200g.</p><p><strong>Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating:</strong><br><em>With 180°&#x2F; 360° object tracking.</em></p><p><strong>Pricing: $200</strong></p><h3 id="2-Apai-Genie"><a href="#2-Apai-Genie" class="headerlink" title="2.

Zhiyun Crane 2"></a>3. Zhiyun Crane 2</h3><p>If barrel shots worry you or if the payload has been a problem, Zhiyum Crane 2 comes with features you badly need and ones you didn’t even know you needed.</p><p>You can call Crane 2 more than the ordinary. Unlike most auto-follow camera mounts, Zhiyun Crane 2 goes a step further to offer dual follow focus – digital and mechanical. With a tactile focus wheel and three different levels of focus adjustment, this bot is more reliable to follow your moves than a legit cameraman!</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Intuitive OLED Display</li></ul><p>Stay connected with not just your pictures but also your cameraman with this feature. Keep your battery in check, switch between control modes, moderate EV, AV, and ISO with this intuitive display design.</p><ul><li>Extra Battery, Extra Payload<br>Crane 2 understands that adventure should be limitless and hence, the 18-hour long battery life with a single charge. It takes ‘charge and forget’ to a new level. With its maximum 3.2kg capacity, Crane 2 also sets a benchmark in the segment.</li><li>Cutting-Edge Design</li></ul><p>Crane 2’s design is essentially all about convenience and throughout its body, you’ll find innovative upgrades to regular camera mounts that can make a filmmaker’s life easier.

Zhiyun Smooth 4"></a>4. Zhiyun Smooth 4</h3><p>This one lives up to its tagline, ‘born for the mobile filmmakers’ owing to its superior features that assist you in creating professional content. Being an extremely efficient, precision and speed-driven auto-tracking camera mount, Zhiyun Smooth 4 is definitely a catch. Especially with the jaw-dropping price that it is offered at.</p><p>With this auto-follow camera mount, you can be not only hands-free but also worry-free. Although the bot cannot capture a full circle, the sensitivity of tracking is hard to match.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Focus Pull and Zoom</li></ul><p>Smooth 4 operates on an inbuilt handwheel configured into a focus puller that makes the experience so smooth. That combined with the powerful Phone Go Mode, whether its zooming or switching focus, the transition will never disrupt the aesthetics with this auto-follow camera mount.</p><ul><li>Lapses and Slo-Mos</li></ul><p>Why limit to time-lapses when you can capture motion-lapse and hyper-lapses as well as detailed slow motions? These lapses are further complemented with the wide-range and triaxial modes to capture unbelievably artistic shots.</p><p><strong>Supported Devices:</strong></p><p>Compatible with all phones and accessories like LED lights and camera lenses.</p><p><strong>Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating: 4.5&#x2F;5</strong><br><em>With 200° tilt and 300° pan object tracking.</em></p><p><strong>Pricing: $99</strong></p><h3 id="5-PivoPod"><a href="#5-PivoPod" class="headerlink" title="5. PivoPod"></a>5. PivoPod</h3><p>Do you dream of a cameraman that follows you around, obeys your commands on the flick of your finger, captures your precious moments most beautifully, and doesn’t get drained out too soon? With unbeatable features, unreal precision, unprecedented tracking sensitivity, and super attractive price, PivoPod might just be the auto-tracking camera mount you’re looking for.</p><p>The automatic tracking feature of this cameraman in the face of a camera mount is equipped with additional intuitive technologies that enable autofocus as well as auto-zoom. So you not only have a bot that follows you around but also one that captures the best shots.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Video Calling and Live Streaming</li></ul><p>Pivo saves you the time, energy, and hassle to detach, scroll, and switch. With its multitasking features, you can not just record your moments of movement but also stream them live or on a video call! Present, dance around, or simply enjoy animated actions with auto track on your calls.</p><ul><li>Voice and Gesture Control</li></ul><p>Gone are the days you needed to rely on remotes only to forget where you left them. Train your PivoPod (by feeding them voice and gesture data) and simply have it follow your commands anywhere, anytime.</p><ul><li>Remote Control</li></ul><p>Too far or busy to control with voice? PivoPod is prepared for every scenario with its remote control option.</p><p><strong>Supported Devices:</strong></p><p>Only compatible with smartphones.</p><p><strong>Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating: 4.8&#x2F;5</strong><br><em>With 360° object tracking.</em></p><p><strong>Pricing: $109</strong></p><h2 id="Which-Camera-Mount-Should-You-Buy"><a href="#Which-Camera-Mount-Should-You-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Which Camera Mount Should You Buy?"></a><strong>Which Camera Mount Should You Buy?</strong></h2><p>All in all, each camera mount comes with its own USP, and you have to make a choice based on your priorities. When on a tight budget, you can compromise a bit on visual flexibility and go for Zhiyun Smooth 4.

Most of the time, a teacher will tell you what to do for your homework and then hand you an assignment sheet with it written down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/long-educational-videos.jpg"                      alt="long educational videos"                ></p><p>When students are confused about the material, they will look for shortcuts. The best way to deal with this is to provide them multiple opportunities to learn each concept. Students will also want to skip the videos when there is too much text or questions on the same topic and if they are bored, distracted, or do not care about the content.</p><p>Students should be engaged by the material shown when watching educational videos. They should be able to comprehend the material and apply it to their own lives.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Why-the-students-can’t-skip-videos-on-Edgenuity"><a href="#Part-III-Why-the-students-can’t-skip-videos-on-Edgenuity" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Why the students can’t skip videos on Edgenuity?"></a>Part III: Why the students can’t skip videos on Edgenuity?</h2><p>There are various reasons why they have yet to provide the option to skip videos.</p><ul><li>Mainly, the system is in-built, which is why you can’t skip.</li><li>It may be for a commercial reason</li><li>It also increases revenue.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/faster-edgenuity-videos.jpg"                      alt="faster edgenuity videos"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-Are-there-any-techniques-possibilities-to-skip-videos-in-Edgenuity"><a href="#Part-IV-Are-there-any-techniques-possibilities-to-skip-videos-in-Edgenuity" class="headerlink" title="Part IV.
