When editing video, there is a transition between every edit or cut. The easiest audio transitions in Premiere Pro are when you switch directly from one scene to the next. This enables a seamless changeover between scenes for the editor. To tie the scenes together and make the change from one scene to the next seem seamless, it usually happens gradually. The transition that seasoned videographers utilize most often is this one.</p><p>A scene or speech transition in which the audio gradually (or abruptly) lowers in volume are known as an audio fade out. If you want to know about how to crossfade audio in premiere pro, then we’ve got you covered. It is a common sort of transition that may be used to soften a transition between two clips or to smooth out a cut. However, switching between clips without any extra special effects might sometimes seem difficult to viewers. Follow the steps below to cross fade audio in Premiere Pro.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Constant Gain</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Constant Power</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Exponential Fade</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Alternative way to add audio transitions in videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms “fade-in” and “fade-out” refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain"><a href="#Constant-Gain" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade’s smoothness. Don’t ignore it however; it does have its uses. You’ll probably use this sparingly.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power"><a href="#Constant-Power" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>In Premiere, the fade that dilutes the audio volume fluctuations between clips is represented by Constant Power. The second clip begins with a rapid spike and then decelerates at the conclusion of the transition. It produces a fluid, cinematic sequence that is understated yet high in quality. ideal for your next movie.</p><p>It is used to gradually reduce audio for the first clip at start, then swiftly when the transition comes to a close. It works by gradually speeding up at the conclusion of the transition before gradually reducing the audio for your initial clip. This crossfades raises audio in the second clip swiftly at initially and then more gradually at the conclusion of the transition.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade"><a href="#Exponential-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>This crossfade operates in an exponential manner, beginning slowly before accelerating till the conclusion of the clip, giving the impression of a moving curve. An audio transition known as an exponential fade begins off slowly before gradually lowering or raising the level until it is finished. It works well for sequences with dialogue switches or for the conclusion. Without the abrupt flip, it provides a considerably shorter fade out that ends fast yet gracefully. Perfect for switching scenes with various atmospheres or for conversation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

So, changing the format such as <strong>AVI to GIF</strong> can be one of the solutions.</p><p>Instead of the full video, people can share short instances in playable GIF file formats on social media apps like WhatsApp, Tumblr, etc. GIF files have smaller sizes, play automatically on devices without any extra software compared to videos, and we can share them during conversations as reactions.</p><p>So, people opt for top apps to convert AVIs to the compressed GIF. With many tools present now, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the avi-to-gif shifting can be done in just steps only.</p><p>Wondering how?

The software is mainly supported on Windows 11&#x2F;10&#x2F;8.1&#x2F;7 OS, and users should update their graphic drivers to the updated version before running it.</p><p>Step1Download the Filmora software on your Windows system and install it, following all the given instructions. Then, launch the software.</p><p>Step2Click on the Import button and choose the media file from your device, or drag it onto the primary editor window. Make sure to choose the video in AVI file format for the <strong>AVI to GIF</strong> conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-to-gif-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the import button"                ></p><p>Step3Drag the files to the timeline and drop them.</p><p>Step4Make editing choices like crop, trim, rotate, speed adjustment, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-to-gif-2.jpg"                      alt="make edting choices"                ></p><p>Step5Cut the duration of the file to a preferred clip since GIF files are usually shorter sections.</p><p>Step6Save by exporting the file through the Export tab and choose the location of the file, the name, and format, i.e., GIF.</p><p>Step7Click on the Export button and choose “GIF” under the “Local” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-to-gif-3.jpg"                      alt="click on the export button"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-convert-AVI-to-GIF-on-Mac"><a href="#How-to-convert-AVI-to-GIF-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="How to convert AVI to GIF on Mac?"></a>How to convert AVI to GIF on Mac?</h3><p>This <strong>AVI GIF converter</strong> is also usable on Mac devices. However, the software is supported on certain OS versions, like macOS v10.14 (Mojave), macOS v10.15 (Catalina), macOS v11 (Big Sur), and macOS v12 (Monterey) only. For older versions, you have to get Filmora v10.5. Also, Boris FX and NewBlue FX are available on specific devices.</p><p>However, you can <strong>convert AVI to GIF</strong> format on most Mac systems without any error unless you are using advanced functions like BorisFX on your Mac device with M1 chipsets. The steps for the process are similar to the Windows version as well.</p><p>Step1Install and launch Filmora 11.</p><p>Step2Add your video file in AVI format by clicking on the Add File button on the screen.</p><p>Step3Cut the video size and adjust speed, color match, add subtitles, and other customizations.</p><p>Step4Click on the Export button and choose the file’s name, format (GIF), and the file saving location in device.</p><p>Step5Press Export for the processing to begin.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-Between-AVI-and-GIF"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-Between-AVI-and-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Comparison Between AVI and GIF"></a>Part 2: Comparison Between AVI and GIF</h2><p>Given that AVI (Audio Visual Interleave) is a video-based format and GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is an image-centric file type, there are considerable differences between both.</p><p>AVI is a Windows and proprietary type of multi-media container format created by a team of developers at Microsoft. On the other hand, a GIF is a type of bitmap image file format, created under a CompuServe team with Steve Wilhite, a capable computer scientist from the United States, at the helm of the project.</p><p>So, in essence, both are vastly different, but have commonalities in certain aspects. For AVI to GIF conversion, knowing what they are should help.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Parameter of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>GIF</strong></th><th><strong>AVI</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>CompuServ</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Development</strong></td><td>June 15, 1987</td><td>November 10, 1992</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Latest Update Date</strong></td><td>1989</td><td>1996</td></tr><tr><td><strong>File Extension</strong></td><td>.GIF</td><td>.AVI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sharing Speed</strong></td><td>It is easy and fast to share GIF files between devices due to their smaller size.</td><td>Since the file is larger in size, the overall speed of transfer would be high.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type of Format</strong></td><td>Bitmap lossless image format</td><td>Container format</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Container For</strong></td><td>-</td><td>Video, audio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td>Compressed file (small size)</td><td>High-quality resolution of the video (upto 4K&#x2F;8K)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cons</strong></td><td>It does not allow much editing.</td><td>The file size can get to very big size limits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Support for B-Frames</strong></td><td>B-framing is compatible with GIFs.</td><td>It was not made with b-frames in consideration but can work with it.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maximum Duration Supported</strong></td><td>The GIF files can extend to 15 seconds maximum.</td><td>The length and duration of these files a user can prepare&#x2F;keep depend on their limit of file storage capacity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Bit Rate Audio</strong></td><td>Not supported.</td><td>It can be detected in AVI and is generally non-standard.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Frame Rate</strong></td><td>GIFs calculate delay render duration per frame, and they run in milliseconds.

How to Merge Multiple AVI Videos to GIF Online?</h3><p>Like using software to <strong>convert AVI to GIF</strong>, you can use specific online conversion tools to merge many GIF files to AVI. The Filmora software is highly capable of merging <strong>AVI to GIF</strong> files as well, but it is not accessible as an online tool.</p><h3 id="2-What-is-the-maximum-size-of-a-GIF-file"><a href="#2-What-is-the-maximum-size-of-a-GIF-file" class="headerlink" title="2.

What is the maximum size of a GIF file?</h3><p>The size of the GIF file is generally very small, and it depends on the particular resolution of the GIF file. Technically, the GIFs are limited to 100MB, although we recommend 8MB or less. Also, the source video resolution should be 720p max, but 480p we be better to go.</p><h3 id="3-Can-you-add-sound-to-a-GIF-If-so-how"><a href="#3-Can-you-add-sound-to-a-GIF-If-so-how" class="headerlink" title="3.

On the other hand, a GIF is a type of bitmap image file format, created under a CompuServe team with Steve Wilhite, a capable computer scientist from the United States, at the helm of the project.</p><p>So, in essence, both are vastly different, but have commonalities in certain aspects.

So without further ado, let’s start!</p><h2 id="Top-10-Websites-to-Download-Free-HDRI"><a href="#Top-10-Websites-to-Download-Free-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Websites to Download Free HDRI"></a>Top 10 Websites to Download Free HDRI</h2><h3 id="Textures-com"><a href="#Textures-com" class="headerlink" title="Textures.com"></a>Textures.com</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-1.jpg"                      alt="textures com"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.6&#x2F;5</p><p>Wouldn’t it be convenient if you could download high-quality sky HDRI in any size you want?</p><p>Well, textures.com offers a wide range of detailed and accurate 3D images that are available to download in different file sizes.</p><p>The website features an ever-growing gigantic library of PBR materials that can be customized according to the project requirement. The library contains 771 sky HDRI that are available to download with a single click upon signing up. The best part is that the website is ad-free, which means you can easily browse all the textures without these annoying ads trying to distract you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>If flexibility is your primary goal, Textures.com is a must-try. Upon signing up for a free account, it offers 15 credits each day to download HDRI and texture for your projects. The HDRIs are available at a low resolution, but with a premium subscription, you can download high-resolution images.</p><h3 id="Hdri-Skies"><a href="#Hdri-Skies" class="headerlink" title="Hdri-Skies"></a>Hdri-Skies</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-2.jpg"                      alt="hdri skies"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.5&#x2F;5</p><p>Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.</p><p>Signing up with a free account allows a free, instant 2k download. However, 20k high-resolution images are behind a paywall and require a premium subscription before you can download them. Hdri-Skies also has 28 volumes of payable full-spherical Skylum aurora hdr for professional use.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Keeping the website free of ads makes it easier to choose the perfect panorama. By giving free access to high-quality images, Hdri-skies is good enough for young digital artists who have just stepped into the field and looking for helpful resources.</p><h3 id="2G-Academy"><a href="#2G-Academy" class="headerlink" title="2G Academy"></a>2G Academy</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-3.jpg"                      alt="2g academy"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.7&#x2F;5</p><p>2G Academy is a group of Indonesian 3D artists working to step up the game of Architecture Visualization by offering free professional high-resolution Sky Hdr for 3D rendering. All the sky maps are available on an instant download for commercial and non-commercial uses.</p><p>It offers over 1000+ sky hdri bringing a quality collection of sky maps for digital artists. Besides offering a vast library of sky hdri, 2G Academy also serves as an educational platform to learn 3D rendering with free youtube tutorials. However, since it is made to target Indonesian 3D artists specifically, the courses are in the Indonesian language.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>The cherry on top is that the website is free of bugging ads, allowing you to sift through the images thoroughly to find the perfect match for your project. Offering a gamut of free sky hdri, 2G Academy is suitable for most needs of amateur and professional artists.</p><h3 id="3D-Art"><a href="#3D-Art" class="headerlink" title="3D Art"></a>3D Art</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-4.jpg"                      alt="3d art"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.6&#x2F;5</p><p>Created and shared by 2g Academy, 3D Art has an ever-growing collection of high-quality HDRIs available for instant download.

Providing a vast library of free resources, 3D Art is an excellent option for digital artists for their 3D Arch Viz Render. It offers free sky maps to any industry that needs to use sky hdri to improve lightning.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>If you want more HDRI, you can subscribe to the premium version. However, 3D Art can be annoying if website ads easily bug you. Nonetheless, the pros of this website easily outweigh its drawbacks. It is best suited for hobbyist digital artists.</p><h3 id="HDR-Maps"><a href="#HDR-Maps" class="headerlink" title="HDR Maps"></a>HDR Maps</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-5.jpg"                      alt="hdr maps"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.7&#x2F;5</p><p>HDR maps is an excellent website if you are looking for high-quality HDR sky images shot at different locations.

Apart from that, the images are directly downloaded into your computer without you first having a look at them, making it difficult to choose if you want to look at multiple pictures before deciding on one.</p><h3 id="Poly-Haven"><a href="#Poly-Haven" class="headerlink" title="Poly Haven"></a>Poly Haven</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-7.jpg"                      alt="poly haven"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.5&#x2F;5</p><p>Like the name, the website is an Poly haven for digital artists.

It helps users to view whatever they are recording and at the same time provides easy navigation options with the touch panel. Thus this device is very handy for framing different shots, checking previews and for reviewing photos or video footages.</p><p>The disadvantage of this touch screen type LCD panel is that it causes very fast decay in battery as compared to the other unit that does not have touch screen panel. The GoPro Black does not have built in LCD panel but it possesses wide angle type lenses that assist users in efficient recording. The photo playback as well as video preview is also easier to watch.</p><ol><li>Weight and Size:</li></ol><p>Both these cameras- Hero4 Silver and Hero4 Black are almost of same dimensions and users can pack them inside same housing during under water shooting. If we talk about weight then the black edition is observed to be little heavier but the maximum weight difference could be just around 5 grams or below 0.2 ounces.</p><h4 id="Image-and-Video-Quality"><a href="#Image-and-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Image and Video Quality:"></a><strong>Image and Video Quality:</strong></h4><ol><li>Still Image:</li></ol><p>The still photos are again almost same as both these devices possess 12MP quality for pictures. Both these cameras can be also adjusted for 5MP and 7MP modes as per need. In this mode selection process, the 12MP resolution serves users with wide FOV whereas in case of 7MP and 5MP you can avail medium level resolution.</p><ol><li>Video:</li></ol><p>Hero4 Black as well as Hero4 Silver; both serves with impressive video quality as they can shoot full HD videos and camera resolution varies up to 4K value. Being the higher end device, naturally you will find Hero4 Black much better for shooting immersive content due to the one major feature difference that is black allows video recording at 60Mbps whereas with silver you can achieve recording speed only up to 45Mbps.</p><ol><li>Audio Quality:</li></ol><p>Most of specifications of both these camera units are almost same so that audio quality is also rated to be almost equivalent. The Black as well as Silver use to initiate recordings at 48 KHz frequency range with advanced compression technology. The automatic gain control mechanism along with internal multi band type compressor is available for overall sound improvement. The mono internal microphones can be attached to both these devices as well as the external microphones can be plugged in via 3.5mm audio jack to mini USB type adapter.</p><p>One of the major differences between both is in their high end audio. The black unit use to possess an advanced analog to digital converter so that much better audio quality can be generated but this studio level audio quality will not work with your silver unit.</p><h4 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line:"></a><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong></h4><p>The price range of GoPro Hero4 Black is $325.00 whereas for Silver you need to pay only $220. Most of the features are comparatively equal so it is good to decide your product as per your budget.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

This model is designed to be a high-caliber Pro selection and a regular use work monitor that has all of the specs necessary for a variety of digital work tasks. If you are looking for a top quality 32-inch monitor for the use of everyday working tasks the UHD 4k monitor is near the top of many pro designers lists.</p><p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p><p> Overall this is a monitor that brings extensive value due to its LCD construction includes professional calibration software, and improved build quality, excellent styling for matching almost any office as well as an improved bright IPS panel, image quality, and Ultra HD resolutions.</p><p> The biggest problems that face this monitor are definitely the OSD calibration which is extremely inflexible; what’s more, the software which does not support the use of high-end instruments or even PC sharing with one keyboard and mouse. Other top-quality professional monitors do include the use of these features but they are also considerably more expensive.</p><h2 id="Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality"><a href="#Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Asus PA 329Q Design Quality"></a>Asus PA 329Q Design Quality</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The overall design of this device includes a 360° rotation for portrait mode, a sturdy and unique stand as well as a height adjustable operation. This is the type of monitor that you can use for ergonomic support day in and day out. The overall design style is made from modern office and it can be made to fit in almost any environment. Including eight ergonomic swivel, pivot, height adjustment and more is an ideal choice for many professionals who are looking for a monitor that they can use for preventing neck strain and improving long working hours each day.</p><p> The look of this monitor also comes with a beautiful logo that improves the branding of the monitor as well as strong materials all finished in matte black. This matte black construction really helps to improve the look of the monitor overall and to make sure that it can fade into almost any office setting. The cabinet finish features a 10 mm bezel which is not too distracting and ensures that if multiple monitors needed to be used for one workstation this could be done quite easily. Overall the monitor size is great and with the design of the adjustments it’s really easy to enjoy a functional design that goes far beyond the average 32 inch television or large display. The comfort adjustments on this make it perfect for professionals.</p><p> The stand and base are manufactured and extremely minimalist design which is functional yet extremely strong and study. This ensures that the entire unit can stand up quite well in a large office or across many cubicles and hours of work. The PA329Q is known for being adjustable in every way that an ASUS is providing for all of its 4 k monitors. If you have used one of these monitors in the past they can be extremely comfortable over long uses making them ideal for a workplace setting.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-ports.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-ports"                ></p><p> The PA 329Q has almost any type of port that you might require in a workplace including four HDMI version 2.0 ports, mini display port 1.2 a standard display port 1.2 as well as five USB 3.0 ports, a nine in one card reader as well as an earphone jack.</p><p> Most of these ports are located directly underneath the monitor, and the only problem with this is that it can often lead to troubles with cord management. While most of the ports can be easily viewed by tilting the monitor, sometimes it can be difficult to plug items in for connectivity without first raising the monitor up or even tilting it all the way down. Once you have the monitor configured and everything plugged in, it’s quite easy to use for day to day operations.</p><p> The overall design of the ports and the location of these ports is for a minimalist design with the look of many items, such as cords and empty ports hidden away from view. Most of the settings and button features can be found along the side of the monitor where they can sometimes be hidden from view. When using the monitor in portrait mode these ports become much more accessible. For most high-end monitors, these types of ports are expected but it’s tough to find too many monitors that have such a wealth of ports available for use at one time.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-osd.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-osd"                ></p><p> The overall settings are handled by joystick navigation through the large OSD. There are many color options including quick fit resolution, a full menu of color options, input selections, blue light filters calibration tools and more. For the most part, calibration can be done with splendid menus which are available just out of the box. Additional features can also be found throughout the menu to improve connectivity and the use of the menus throughout usage. There is even an option to create alignments based off of actual paper sizes so that you can create very precise editing and proofing on documents before they print.</p><p> There are eight different picture modes available throughout the settings including sRBG, Adobe RPG and a variety of other factory settings. Putting locks into the brightness as well as color can make sure that full adjustments stay through multiple shifts and working conditions. Blue light filters also come with four different options ensuring that you can get compensation based off of the types of color settings you work best with. The color menu adjustments include sliders for all six colors and under the advanced submenu, there are some fine tuning adjustments that you won’t find on many other types of professional monitors.</p><p> The remaining types of picture controls can be found throughout the image submenu which allows for adjustments in sharpness, overscan, aspect control toggles and more. The Vivid Pixel enhancement option also allows for improved contrast between dark and light objects across the screen. The dynamic feature will improve the range of shadows for animation work for example.</p><h4 id="2-Color-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#2-Color-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2. Color and Image Quality"></a>2. Color and Image Quality</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-rgb.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-rgb"                ></p><p> Overall this is a monitor designed for professional use and includes a wide color gamut of 100% REC .709, 99.5% Adobe RGB, wide color gamut for vibrant images and more. There are color spaces for video editing in 2020 as well as true to life color reproduction.</p><p> What’s really incredible with the color and image quality is the full customization that is available to professionals. Through the menus, it’s possible to change brightness settings, calibrate for animation and improved contrast as well as deliver improved support for working within Adobe and other video editing and production suites.</p><p> This device can produce 1.0 7 billion colors with the chance to produce over 1024 shades of each primary color. The screen is made up of a 10-bit panel and there is a 14-bit lookup table for a huge color gamut. There is also amazing gamma correction and color recalculation to represent the differences between colors and to finally produce a true to life image based off of the closest specifications and measurements on a print product.</p><p> Overall the image quality and color quality is perfect especially when the settings are dialed in the only aspect where this monitor falls short however is with brightness uniformity. Even many of the top Asus monitors find difficulty with uniformity compensation throughout the monitor face and this makes brightness at a fixed level of premium. The pure resolution and the size of the monitor ensures that pixels are close to invisible and the antiglare matte coating on the monitor makes it easy to read and easy to see colors in a variety of different lighting settings.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration"><a href="#3-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration"></a>3. Calibration</h4><p> Overall this monitor is extremely easy to work on right out-of-the-box. The calibration technology on ASUS however has always been a cut above. The PA329Q delivers DCI PIII color space support. The device also comes with a factory data calibration sheet ensuring that artists and creative professionals can calibrate specifically for Adobe RGB modes, s RGB modes and the latest in industry standards. The ASUS proARt calibration technology software also comes with all of the latest presets for editing software worldwide. New standards and improvements can be constantly fed through the software to ensure improved performance results.</p><p> As well as the features the color calibration tools that ASUS included just in the menu with the PA329Q make it extremely easy to calibrate in its multiple picture modes as well as through advanced settings that can all be found on the monitor.</p><h4 id="4-Eye-Care-Mode"><a href="#4-Eye-Care-Mode" class="headerlink" title="4.Eye Care Mode"></a>4.Eye Care Mode</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker"                ></p><p> In eye care mode the Asus offers a flicker free operation with a low blue light. The idea of this type of technology is to produce a beautiful image quality with very high refresh rates. This can work to protect the eyes over a long shift and prevent dry eye symptoms that are common amongst design and image editing professionals. This type of technology is an ASUS only creation and it shows they are willing to go a step beyond for creative professionals.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Overall this is a top quality professional monitor due to both of its performance, the hardware and the amazing amount of settings that are available under the hood. Although it might not be ideal if you are going to be getting into fast PC gaming, it is the perfect and budget friendly professional options for creative professionals looking for a 4k monitor.

Starting from opening titles and ending credits to transition slides and text snippets, texts and titles always enhance video content. It is quite obvious that animated texts draw more attention than showing static text effects. If you are new to video editing and text animation, you should be aware of the common types of text animation.</p><p>You should use these common text animations in your videos because the viewers are already comfortable watching them. Apart from using them directly, you should use them to create some interesting and stunning text animations so that the video looks different from others. We have listed down the common as well as interesting text animation examples for you.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Parallax scrolling</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Fade in and fade out</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Sliding text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Text breaks away animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Typing text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Morphing Text Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Combined Slide Out Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">The Stomp Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">The Curtain Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Animated Text Outline Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-6">Animated Text Fill Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-7">Neon Light Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-8">In and Out of Focus Text Effect</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Make a Text Animation Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation"></a>Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation" class="headerlink" title="4.

Most companies and content creators today use them in their videos to facilitate easy understanding of their videos. Thus, allowing their videos to get higher engagement and views.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?"></a>Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?</h2><p>To create a .srt file for your video on a Windows computer is pretty simple. Yes, you don’t require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.</p><p>That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio&#x2F;dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.</p><p>The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;</p><p>Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-1.jpg"                      alt="create a new file"                ></p><p>Step2 Up next, play your video and listen to the first line of the dialogue. Then pause it and write your first subtitle in the note by doing the following;</p><ul><li>Type 1 &gt; under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;</li></ul><p><em>1</em></p><ul><li><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></li></ul><p>The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.</p><p>Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.</p><p>Step4 Repeat steps 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>Below is an example of what an SRT subtitle should look like;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p><em>Hello, and welcome to our presentation.</em></p><p><em>2</em></p><p><em>00:00:012,108 –&gt; 00:00:16,357</em></p><p><em>In this video, we’ll be showing</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle"                ></p><p>Step5 Review the subtitle and edit every error after you’ve completed it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="review subtitle"                ></p><p>Step6 Finally, save the file in .srt format by clicking <strong>‘File’ &gt; Save.</strong> Then under <strong>‘Save As’</strong> enter the file name and add .srt as the preferred extension for your file.

So, if you’re looking to create SRT, this article has introduced all effective methods that you can always rely on to get the job done seamlessly.</p><p>You can create SRT on Windows using Notepad or on Mac using TextEdit. However, to edit SRT with high quality, Filmora is the best software to come to your rescue for such an operation.</p><p>Part 1: What are SRT subtitles?</p><p>Before we proceed to the main discussion of the day, it’ll be necessary to understand what SRT subtitles are first.</p><p>SRT Subtitles (SubRip subtitles) are text formats that are generated from DVD-ripping software SubRip. Most companies and content creators today use them in their videos to facilitate easy understanding of their videos. Thus, allowing their videos to get higher engagement and views.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?"></a>Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?</h2><p>To create a .srt file for your video on a Windows computer is pretty simple. Yes, you don’t require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.</p><p>That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio&#x2F;dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.</p><p>The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;</p><p>Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-1.jpg"                      alt="create a new file"                ></p><p>Step2 Up next, play your video and listen to the first line of the dialogue. Then pause it and write your first subtitle in the note by doing the following;</p><ul><li>Type 1 &gt; under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;</li></ul><p><em>1</em></p><ul><li><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></li></ul><p>The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.</p><p>Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.</p><p>Step4 Repeat steps 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>Below is an example of what an SRT subtitle should look like;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p><em>Hello, and welcome to our presentation.</em></p><p><em>2</em></p><p><em>00:00:012,108 –&gt; 00:00:16,357</em></p><p><em>In this video, we’ll be showing</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle"                ></p><p>Step5 Review the subtitle and edit every error after you’ve completed it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="review subtitle"                ></p><p>Step6 Finally, save the file in .srt format by clicking <strong>‘File’ &gt; Save.</strong> Then under <strong>‘Save As’</strong> enter the file name and add .srt as the preferred extension for your file. Click the ‘Save’ button to complete the task.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-create-an-SRT-file-for-video-on-Mac-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-create-an-SRT-file-for-video-on-Mac-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to create an SRT file for video on Mac?"></a>Part 3: How to create an SRT file for video on Mac?</h2><p>Are you using a Mac computer? Don’t panic, we got you covered with the step-by-step instructions to create a .srt subtitle file and such a computer.</p><p>The process of creating a .srt file for video on Mac is quite similar to .srt file creation on Windows. You don’t require the installation of a third-party program. However, on Mac, you’ll use TextEdit as Notepad is not supported.</p><p>Let’s proceed to the stepwise guide on how to make an SRT file by yourself for video on Mac without wasting time;</p><p>Step1 Turn on your Mac computer and start TextEdit.</p><p>Step2 Create a new file. But before writing any subtitle captions, play the video whose subtitle you want to write and listen to the first line of the audio.</p><p>After you’ve grabbed the first line, type 1 and write the first Timestamp in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds.</p><p>Here is an example of what you should do;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the times indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the screen.</p><p>Step3 Type your subtitle content in the next line. If it’s a long text, you need to break it down into multiple subtitles.</p><p>Step4 Repeat step 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>See what an SRT subtitle looks like below;</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-mac-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle on mac"                ></p><p>Step5 Review and edit the subtitle.</p><p>Step6 To complete the operation, click <strong>‘File’</strong> at the top bar and select <strong>Save</strong> from the drop-down. Then navigate to ‘<strong>Save As’</strong> and type your file name, and change the extension from .txt to .srt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-mac-2.jpg"                      alt="click on file"                ></p><p>Make sure you Uncheck the ‘Hide Extension’ and ‘If no extension is provided’ checkboxes.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Smile-Saver-Essential-Free-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Smile-Saver-Essential-Free-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Smile Saver: Essential Free Meme Templates"></a>Smile Saver: Essential Free Meme Templates</h2><p>When creating a meme, you will find that it is much easier to start with a pre-designed template. The creators of these temples take into account what is needed to create the perfect meme and even the dimensions needed to upload the meme to various social media sites. This eliminates a lot of work for you, allowing you to create a meme in a few minutes; after all, you can just select a pre-made template and change the images and text to suit your project’s needs.</p><p>In this article, we will be looking at some of the best places to find free meme templates that you can then use to create your memes. All the memes that you can find on all these sites are available to download and edit. If you want to create a meme from scratch, you can download the meme template and use a photo editor to change all aspects of the template.</p><h2 id="Canva-Meme-Theme"><a href="#Canva-Meme-Theme" class="headerlink" title="Canva Meme Theme"></a>Canva Meme Theme</h2><p>Canva is one of the most popular photo editing tools in the market and one of the things that Canva users love about this platform is the availability of templates. There is a meme template on Canva for any type of meme that you would like to create and once you have settled on the meme that you would like to use, you can then use the Canva editor to customize it as desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/canva-meme-theme.jpg"                      alt="canva meme theme"                ></p><p>Canva makes it very easy to find the template you need as the templates are arranged under various categories. You can also use various filters including filters, style, theme, price, and color to find the perfect template. Most of the themes on Canva are free but there are some advanced templates that you can access on a paid subscription or for a one-time fee.</p><p>The Canva editor has a lot of different features to allow you to edit your selected template in various ways. You can change the color, text font, and images or even re-orient the entire template so you end up with a unique meme to suit your needs.</p><h2 id="Kapwing-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Kapwing-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing Meme Templates"></a>Kapwing Meme Templates</h2><p>Kapwing is another online photo editing tool that also comes with a built-in meme generator. One of the benefits of choosing Kapwing is the numerous templates that you can use to create a unique meme. Each of the templates that you find on Kapwing is completely customizable. You can change the color of the existing images, add your images, change the text font and color and even remove or replace the meme’s background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="kapwing meme templates"                ></p><p>Kapwing also makes it easy for you to find the templates that you need. All available templates on Kapwing are neatly arranged in various categories. The “Trending Now” category allows you to find memes that are relevant to the current market and may get you the best engagement.</p><h2 id="Adobe-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Adobe-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Meme Templates"></a>Adobe Meme Templates</h2><p>If you are looking to create unique and high-quality memes, Adobe Express is one of the best tools to use. This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="adobe meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.</p><p>The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged. The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.</p><h2 id="ImgFlip-Meme-Template"><a href="#ImgFlip-Meme-Template" class="headerlink" title="ImgFlip Meme Template"></a>ImgFlip Meme Template</h2><p>If you are not looking to create highly sophisticated memes, ImgFlip is a great simple solution that you can use. There are thousands of meme templates to choose from, arranged in various genres and themes. Since the templates are added every day, the site has a very convenient search function that you can use to find the most reliable meme for your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/imgflip-meme-template.jpg"                      alt="imgflip meme template"                ></p><p>But ImgFlip is not a complete photos editor, meaning that you may not able to change the template too much. The only thing you can do with this tool is to change the caption o the template which can be valuable if you find the right meme template. Once the caption has been added, you can then download the completed meme and then upload it to various social media sites.</p><h2 id="Wepik-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Wepik-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Wepik Meme Templates"></a>Wepik Meme Templates</h2><p>Wepik is another great site if you are looking for different types of memes to use. There are thousands of memes that you can choose from and they are updated every day, giving you a wide variety of choices. The most popular and the newest meme templates are available on the first page, but you can also use the search function to find a particular meme template that may not be on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wepik-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="wepik meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you have selected the meme that you want to use, Wepik shows you details about the template you have chosen. You can then use the Wepik editor to customize the template in various ways. You can use numerous tools to change the color of the meme, edit the text on the meme or even edit the image. Once you are happy with the changes, you can then download the meme to post to your social media pages.</p><h2 id="Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge of Meme Templates"></a>Knowledge of Meme Templates</h2><p><strong>1. Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.

Even those that have not had the chance to fly one have seen the great work on the internet and aerial shots for the advertisements, TV programs and films they watch on a regular basis. New technologies are constantly making drones better than anyone could have ever imagined and the DJI Phantom 4 is a great example of where this next level of technology has taken us. This new release has a better design, additional flight options and a special system to avoid objects should they get in the way of your drones flight path.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 11 Best DJI Phantom 4 Accessories to Buy &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phandom-4.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CFXQZD0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01CFXQZD0&linkId=edcac98fb2e38b9359b8299650e268df" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Complete-Review-for-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#Complete-Review-for-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="Complete Review for DJI Phantom 4"></a>Complete Review for DJI Phantom 4</h2><h4 id="Pros-of-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#Pros-of-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros of DJI Phantom 4"></a><strong>Pros of DJI Phantom 4</strong></h4><ul><li>Obstacle sensing system</li><li>Two cameras for distance recognition</li><li>Artificial intelligence</li><li>Connects to GPS and GLONASS</li><li>New gimbal for sturdier videos and ease of maneuvering</li><li>Lighter frame</li><li>30 fps videos and 120 fps capabilities</li><li>Improved lens</li><li>Travels up to 45 mph</li><li>Easy to fly</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-of-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#Cons-of-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons of DJI Phantom 4"></a><strong>Cons of DJI Phantom 4</strong></h4><ul><li>Set up time</li><li>Missing set up guidelines making it harder for novice operators</li><li>Small branch recognition</li><li>Batter lasts 28 minutes up to 5km</li><li>$169 for extra battery power</li></ul><h4 id="Feature-and-specs"><a href="#Feature-and-specs" class="headerlink" title="Feature and specs"></a>Feature and specs</h4><ul><li>Weight : (Battery &amp; Propellers Included) 1388 g</li><li>Max Ascent Speed: S-mode: 6 m&#x2F;s - P-mode: 5 m&#x2F;s</li><li>Max Flight Time : 30 minutes approximately</li><li>Obstacle Sensory Range: 0.6 - 23 feet (0.2 - 7 m)</li><li>Vision System: Forward Vision System, Backward Vision System, Downward Vision System</li><li>Battery Type: LiPo 4S</li><li>Max Video Bitrate 100 Mbps</li><li>Supported File Systems :FAT32 (≤32 GB); exFAT (&gt;32 GB)</li><li>Photo: JPEG, DNG (RAW), JPEG + DNG</li><li>Video: MP4&#x2F;MOV (AVC&#x2F;; &#x2F;)</li><li>Supported SD Cards: Micro SD</li><li>Max Capacity: 128GB</li><li>Write speed ≥15MB&#x2F;s, Class 10 or UHS-1 rating required</li></ul><h4 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phantom-4-design.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4 review"                ></p><p> The Phantom 4 is similar to the previous version in terms of looks. It is white in color and plastic with sturdy legs to rest on. Two sensors are located on the front and back of the drone and more underneath and to the sides. The camera begins to record on takeoff allowing the drone to find a homing position when ready to return home. The camera hangs below the drone with gimbals that keep it sturdy whatever conditions it is flown in. The arms each have lights so that you can find it easily when in flight.</p><h4 id="Battery-life"><a href="#Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="Battery life"></a>Battery life</h4><p> Underneath the shell of the Phantom 4 is the battery which is high density at 5,870Ah. This allows it to be flown for up to half an hour.</p><h4 id="Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors"><a href="#Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors" class="headerlink" title="Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors"></a>Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors</h4><p> The Phantom 4 has a high performance system to avoid objects. The front, back and sides all have sensors which are able to detect potential hazards from around 98 feet with or not they are in front of the drone or behind it. An example of where this would be useful is flying it through a doorway indoors as it is able to go through the doorway without being in danger of crashing into the door frame. Even at 31 miles an hour the avoidance system still works. They do switch off however when you switch to sports mode with increased speed capabilities of 40 miles an hour.</p><h4 id="Flight-performance"><a href="#Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="Flight performance"></a>Flight performance</h4><p> One of the great features enjoyed by Phantom 4 owners is ‘draw’. This allows users to draw a line on their screen for their drone to follow at the same altitude. You can keep the camera in a forward position or leave it free to move such as in follow mode. The sensors in flight not only detect people in the way but also other objects including cars, bikes and trees. The camera locks to its subject continually while the drone fly’s as set out by the user. The TapFly function allows you to get the drone to go in the direction of where you tapped, by using the TapFly backwards you can make it fly in the opposite direction all while the avoidance system works (except in sports mode). Return to home allows you to get the drone to return to its setting off point easily as it records the route and even chooses the one that is best for the conditions it is being flown in to avoid damage.</p><h4 id="Control-range"><a href="#Control-range" class="headerlink" title="Control range"></a>Control range</h4><p> The Phantom 4 plus comes with a built in screen which has a display screen of 5.5 inches and 1080p. The remote is able to connect to the drone from up to 4.3 miles away and can stream full HD to the display screen. The remote battery can last for up to 5 hours before it needs to be charged.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phantom-4-camera.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4 review"                ></p><p> The Phantom 4 has been upgraded to include a 20 megapixel sensor which has 12 dynamic range stops which allows for more detailed shots even in intense light. This improves the performance from its predecessor significantly. The mechanical shutter stops the distortion and makes for smoother footage. The 4K video at 60 fps capabilities increase the quality overall giving users better results.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> The Phantom 4 literally does everything you could need it to. It flies well in all kinds of conditions, reaches great speeds to capture sports play and even avoids objects that would otherwise give users and their drones quite an unhappy ending. As the Phantom 4 is so easy to fly it means that users can concentrate on their footage. With the follow me mode users can literally go hands free and still get great results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-pivotal-processes-for-privacy-preserving-photography/"><u>In 2024, Pivotal Processes for Privacy-Preserving Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-leading-360-action-footage-options/"><u>[Updated] Leading 360° Action Footage Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/stabilizing-shaky-images-a-realistic-benefit-or-hype-for-2024/"><u>Stabilizing Shaky Images  A Realistic Benefit or Hype for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-invent-iconic-images-through-giphy/"><u>In 2024, Invent Iconic Images Through Giphy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-starting-with-social-giving-best-practices-for-fb-posts/"><u>2024 Approved  Starting with Social Giving  Best Practices for FB Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premier-8-webcams-to-elevate-your-livestreams/"><u>2024 Approved  Premier 8 Webcams to Elevate Your Livestreams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/investigating-the-innovation-in-burst-mode-filming-techniques-for-2024/"><u>Investigating the Innovation in Burst Mode Filming Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-prohero-gopro-vs-nikkor-keymission-camera-faceoff/"><u>In 2024, ProHero GoPro VS Nikkor Keymission Camera Faceoff</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-review-movavi-video-pro-2024-enhanced-edition/"><u>[Updated] Review  Movavi Video Pro 2024 Enhanced Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snap-motion-blur-photos-effortlessly-with-iphone-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved  Snap Motion-Blur Photos Effortlessly with iPhone Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-interactive-learning-strategies-in-video-editing/"><u>In 2024, Interactive Learning  Strategies in Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-noshadowedit-advanced-background-shadow-elimination/"><u>2024 Approved  NoShadowEdit  Advanced Background Shadow Elimination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-mind-games-top-trivia-channels-for-24/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Mind Games – Top Trivia Channels for '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/silent-sounds-elegant-dimming-in-garageband-projects-for-2024/"><u>Silent Sounds  Elegant Dimming in Garageband Projects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-master-image-editing-with-these-top-8-tablets-beyond-filmoras-reach/"><u>[New] Master Image Editing with These Top 8 Tablets  Beyond Filmora's Reach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/leading-action-cams-that-keep-moving-steady-for-2024/"><u>Leading Action Cams That Keep Moving Steady for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-visual-storytelling-with-free-images-from-these-esteemed-online-portals/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Visual Storytelling with Free Images From These Esteemed Online Portals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-pros-in-mac-streaming-the-top-5-applications/"><u>[Updated] Pros in Mac Streaming  The Top 5 Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-tight-scenes-minecraft-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating Tight Scenes  Minecraft Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-screenplay-basics-penning-dynamic-characters-speeches/"><u>In 2024, Screenplay Basics  Penning Dynamic Characters' Speeches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-overcoming-compression-artifacts-on-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Overcoming Compression Artifacts on YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-samsungs-latest-bd-edition-k850-update/"><u>[New] Samsung's Latest BD Edition -

Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.</p><p>However, photo to cartoon software products require some previous photo editing experience since you will have to do much more than apply an effect to a photo in order to make a photo look like a cartoon. We’ve selected some of the <strong>best photo to cartoon software</strong> products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Photo-to-Cartoon-Software-Products-for-Windows-Mac"><a href="#Top-10-Photo-to-Cartoon-Software-Products-for-Windows-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Photo to Cartoon Software Products for Windows &amp; Mac"></a>Top 10 Photo to Cartoon Software Products for Windows &amp; Mac</h2><p>Even though you can cartoon photos with each photo to cartoon software we included in this article, which effects you will have to use depends on the software and the style of the cartoon you’re trying to create. So, let’s take a look at what these photo to cartoon software products have to offer.</p><h3 id="2-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#2-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Photoshop"></a>2. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20.99 per month as a single app</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Adobe Photoshop is one of the best photo editing software ever created, which is why it is hardly surprising that it can help you to cartoon a photo. Photoshop’s rich selection of effects includes a number of effects you can use to turn a photo into a cartoon.</p><p>However, you will also have to create several layers, change blend modes, and create masks. Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.</p><h3 id="3-Paint-net"><a href="#3-Paint-net" class="headerlink" title="3. Paint.net"></a>3. Paint.net</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>PC owners in need of a simple photo editing software that can help them turn a photo into a cartoon are going to love using Paint.net. This is a simple photo editor that has more to offer than Microsoft Paint, and it is as easy to use.</p><p>In order to cartoon a photo with Paint.net, you just have to import it into the editor and then head over to the Effects menu.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Online-and-Local-Photos-How-to-Unite-Them"><a href="#Online-and-Local-Photos-How-to-Unite-Them" class="headerlink" title="Online and Local Photos: How to Unite Them"></a>Online and Local Photos: How to Unite Them</h2><p>Often you may want to create your poster or a collage of photos, but at the same time, you want to do this without having to learn to use photo-retouching tools very complex, such as those provided by software such as Adobe Photoshop. And then, online programs could become very useful to overlay and merge images in a desktop version, without you having to download anything. Curious to discover these programs?</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Online Image Editor</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">LunaPic</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">IMGonline</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">PicMonkey</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Phixr</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Part 2.

Online Image Editor"></a>1. Online Image Editor</h3><p>Online Image Editor is a free online tool that makes the image overlay operation easy to do. Moreover, this website does not put any limit on the number of images or photos to be superimposed, even if the only way to do it is to overlap them one at a time, and not altogether. In practice, Online Image Editor works literally in layers, with the next image that overlaps with the previous one, and so on. To underline the fact that the images should not necessarily be superimposed, but also juxtaposed to one another on the same background, or rotated, or with various background effects such as shadows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-1.jpg"                      alt="online image editor"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>The user interface is simple and friendly with numerous editing features</li><li>Images can be crafted in an excellent manner</li><li>Optimum and consistent performance is assured</li><li>Fotor offers a one-tap enhancement tool that spontaneously touches up normal images</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Many distractive ads keep showing up</li><li>Special image editing background is required</li><li>Effects cannot be tweaked with Fotor</li><li>The font sizes cannot be changed in an independent manner</li><li>In the free version, many features and functionalities have been disabled</li></ul><h3 id="2-LunaPic"><a href="#2-LunaPic" class="headerlink" title="2. LunaPic"></a>2. LunaPic</h3><p>LunaPic is another free site to superimpose images online. As in the previous case, you can overlay multiple photos, but only one by one, using tools such as transparency control, the various effects of shade, and course the rotation. In addition, you can upload photos not only from your PC but also from social networks like Facebook or simply from Google Images. The main flaw, of Online Image Editor, is the impossibility of canceling the overlap of the first images: you can only delete the last one you added.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-2.jpg"                      alt="lunapic"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>A great collection of features and editing tools are made available</li><li>The in-built collage maker has made the editor highly popular</li><li>Several fun features have been included</li><li>The user interface is intuitive</li><li>Unique designs can be created simply by dragging and dropping</li><li>The inbuilt collage maker offers ease of use</li><li>Bold fonts, mesmerizing background colors, and a host of original layouts included</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Many nagging ads would keep popping up and would distract you</li><li>You cannot create your photo collage</li><li>Eraser tool is not included</li><li>Several of the listed features come for a price tag</li></ul><h3 id="3-IMGonline"><a href="#3-IMGonline" class="headerlink" title="3. IMGonline"></a>3. IMGonline</h3><p>IMGonline is a free platform very useful to superimpose images: while presenting the same limitations as previous sites, this platform has the merit of maintaining much of the quality of the photos, even in the case of PNG files. Also on this site, there are various transparency and shadow effects and, despite having the same defects as the others, it is more immediate and quicker to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-3.jpg"                      alt="imgonline"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>You can carry out resizing or cropping of your images with ease</li><li>The package comes accompanied by a special collection of seasonal filters</li><li>Many pro features, touchups, frames, stickers, and alluring effects are included</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It does not have an in-built library from where images can be chosen for learning editing</li><li>Other special effects and font types, more than what is available, can be included</li><li>The primary website of Ribbet lacks definitive or distinguishing features</li></ul><h3 id="4-PicMonkey"><a href="#4-PicMonkey" class="headerlink" title="4. PicMonkey"></a>4. PicMonkey</h3><p>Even PicMonkey is an online editor that performs its duty, and it does so with simplicity and by following the standards of the other sites seen in our list. One of its major strengths is the drag &amp; drop option and the ability to resize images simply by clicking with the mouse cursor on the corners. But the real gem of PicMonkey is another: unlike its competitors, this site will allow you to edit any image already overlaid, if you have not already merged. Finally, being an editor, you can also edit images with various effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-4.jpg"                      alt="picmonkey"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Many artistic elements that are cool and easy to use are available</li><li>The output file’s size can be customized</li><li>Images can be opened from or saved to different storage media with relative ease</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>You would find it extremely difficult to work on pictures greater than one at a time</li><li>Ads keep flashing which distracts and affects productivity</li><li>You can avail it for a lesser duration of 7 days only in trial mode</li></ul><h3 id="5-Phixr"><a href="#5-Phixr" class="headerlink" title="5. Phixr"></a>5. Phixr</h3><p>Phixr is an excellent alternative to the sites seen previously: unlike the others, it allows you to upload multiple images in one shot, but you can’t overlay them at the same time. As usual, you can change the transparency level, the shadows, the size, and the rotation. Unfortunately, every action you do will be irreversible, so this could bring you a lot of frustration: for this reason, our advice is to use it especially if you need to quickly overlay multiple images, without paying too much attention to the result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-5.jpg"                      alt="phixr"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Advanced range of image editing tools is available under one roof</li><li>Stellar performance can be achieved through different complexity levels</li><li>The interface is interactive and easy to work around</li><li>Offers editing features available in advanced software versions</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Sometimes, special image editing background is needed to work with</li><li>The images can be resized using complex function</li><li>Downloads have to be periodically done in an extensive manner</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Best-3-programs-for-overlaying-photos"><a href="#Part-2-Best-3-programs-for-overlaying-photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Best 3 programs for overlaying photos"></a>Part 2. Best 3 programs for overlaying photos</h2><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>To find powerful image or video overlay software, Filmora Video Editor will be your choice.

Online Image Editor"></a>1. Online Image Editor</h3><p>Online Image Editor is a free online tool that makes the image overlay operation easy to do. Moreover, this website does not put any limit on the number of images or photos to be superimposed, even if the only way to do it is to overlap them one at a time, and not altogether. In practice, Online Image Editor works literally in layers, with the next image that overlaps with the previous one, and so on. To underline the fact that the images should not necessarily be superimposed, but also juxtaposed to one another on the same background, or rotated, or with various background effects such as shadows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-1.jpg"                      alt="online image editor"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>The user interface is simple and friendly with numerous editing features</li><li>Images can be crafted in an excellent manner</li><li>Optimum and consistent performance is assured</li><li>Fotor offers a one-tap enhancement tool that spontaneously touches up normal images</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Many distractive ads keep showing up</li><li>Special image editing background is required</li><li>Effects cannot be tweaked with Fotor</li><li>The font sizes cannot be changed in an independent manner</li><li>In the free version, many features and functionalities have been disabled</li></ul><h3 id="2-LunaPic-1"><a href="#2-LunaPic-1" class="headerlink" title="2. LunaPic"></a>2. LunaPic</h3><p>LunaPic is another free site to superimpose images online. As in the previous case, you can overlay multiple photos, but only one by one, using tools such as transparency control, the various effects of shade, and course the rotation. In addition, you can upload photos not only from your PC but also from social networks like Facebook or simply from Google Images. The main flaw, of Online Image Editor, is the impossibility of canceling the overlap of the first images: you can only delete the last one you added.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-2.jpg"                      alt="lunapic"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>A great collection of features and editing tools are made available</li><li>The in-built collage maker has made the editor highly popular</li><li>Several fun features have been included</li><li>The user interface is intuitive</li><li>Unique designs can be created simply by dragging and dropping</li><li>The inbuilt collage maker offers ease of use</li><li>Bold fonts, mesmerizing background colors, and a host of original layouts included</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Many nagging ads would keep popping up and would distract you</li><li>You cannot create your photo collage</li><li>Eraser tool is not included</li><li>Several of the listed features come for a price tag</li></ul><h3 id="3-IMGonline-1"><a href="#3-IMGonline-1" class="headerlink" title="3. IMGonline"></a>3. IMGonline</h3><p>IMGonline is a free platform very useful to superimpose images: while presenting the same limitations as previous sites, this platform has the merit of maintaining much of the quality of the photos, even in the case of PNG files. Also on this site, there are various transparency and shadow effects and, despite having the same defects as the others, it is more immediate and quicker to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-3.jpg"                      alt="imgonline"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>You can carry out resizing or cropping of your images with ease</li><li>The package comes accompanied by a special collection of seasonal filters</li><li>Many pro features, touchups, frames, stickers, and alluring effects are included</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It does not have an in-built library from where images can be chosen for learning editing</li><li>Other special effects and font types, more than what is available, can be included</li><li>The primary website of Ribbet lacks definitive or distinguishing features</li></ul><h3 id="4-PicMonkey-1"><a href="#4-PicMonkey-1" class="headerlink" title="4. PicMonkey"></a>4. PicMonkey</h3><p>Even PicMonkey is an online editor that performs its duty, and it does so with simplicity and by following the standards of the other sites seen in our list. One of its major strengths is the drag &amp; drop option and the ability to resize images simply by clicking with the mouse cursor on the corners. But the real gem of PicMonkey is another: unlike its competitors, this site will allow you to edit any image already overlaid, if you have not already merged. Finally, being an editor, you can also edit images with various effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-4.jpg"                      alt="picmonkey"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Many artistic elements that are cool and easy to use are available</li><li>The output file’s size can be customized</li><li>Images can be opened from or saved to different storage media with relative ease</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>You would find it extremely difficult to work on pictures greater than one at a time</li><li>Ads keep flashing which distracts and affects productivity</li><li>You can avail it for a lesser duration of 7 days only in trial mode</li></ul><h3 id="5-Phixr-1"><a href="#5-Phixr-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Phixr"></a>5. Phixr</h3><p>Phixr is an excellent alternative to the sites seen previously: unlike the others, it allows you to upload multiple images in one shot, but you can’t overlay them at the same time. As usual, you can change the transparency level, the shadows, the size, and the rotation. Unfortunately, every action you do will be irreversible, so this could bring you a lot of frustration: for this reason, our advice is to use it especially if you need to quickly overlay multiple images, without paying too much attention to the result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-5.jpg"                      alt="phixr"                ></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Advanced range of image editing tools is available under one roof</li><li>Stellar performance can be achieved through different complexity levels</li><li>The interface is interactive and easy to work around</li><li>Offers editing features available in advanced software versions</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Sometimes, special image editing background is needed to work with</li><li>The images can be resized using complex function</li><li>Downloads have to be periodically done in an extensive manner</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Best-3-programs-for-overlaying-photos-1"><a href="#Part-2-Best-3-programs-for-overlaying-photos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
