## Inside Look: Making Most of Firefox Picture-in-Picture

Using your PC to watch films while working on something else has recently been possible due to the new picture-in-picture mode function. Mozilla Firefox users may utilize this functionality to accomplish two or more things simultaneously.

This feature is an important tool to help you multitask by dragging videos from web pages and navigating to another tab so you can continue working on other tabs while the video keeps playing. In this article, you will understand everything about this feature and how to enable this feature.

![the firefox]( https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. How Picture-in-Picture Mode Works

Picture-in-Picture allows for simple tab navigation without interfering with the video you are viewing. Enabling this feature allows your videos to play in a tiny overlay utilizing a separate video player. Users may move, resize and even pin the player on the screen. You may even switch between tabs without interfering with video playing.

The interface has a play/pause button. You may also recover a video by locating it as well as close the interface by clicking the close button if you wish to. It will return to the initial tab and continue from where it left off when the player was closed.

When your video is in picture-in-picture mode, the video placeholder also displays on the website. "This video is playing in Picture-in-Picture mode," it reads.

Using keyboard shortcuts, you can make adjustments for loudness but not for the video quality. However, you may make these adjustments from the original web page of the film. Also, keep in mind that any modifications to its initial position will affect the floating player. The video will immediately disappear when you refresh or open a new website in that tab.

## Part 2\. How to activate Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in Firefox

Firefox is often considered one of the most data-protective browsers, but that is not all. Mozilla Firefox also comes with a variety of useful tools and features. It even incorporates certain features you can only find through extensions in other browsers.

Firefox, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other current browsers, supports picture-in-picture mode. This functionality allows you to view movies in a floating window while working with other tabs, browsers, desktop apps, and so on.

Because this picture-in-picture panel is an overlay, you may move it to any part of your screen. So, in picture-in-picture mode, you may click play/pause, shut it, or expand it to its full size.

5. Firefox plays the new video above the first. Drag and drop it anywhere to display both.

By following these steps, videos appear on the screen at the same time. For all tabs containing open videos, the main Firefox window shows a "play" symbol. Even if you dismiss Firefox, numerous videos will continue to play in other programs or on your desktop.
