## Part 3\. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail

Two of the most popular productivity tools are Zoom and G Suite, which are utilized by both businesses and individuals. Users can simply book Zoom meetings from inside Google Calendar and invite friends, family, and coworkers to participate thanks to the connectivity between the two.

### Calendar Link Addition

Without the add-on, you may still include a link to a Zoom meeting in a Google Calendar event. Because the add-on requests a ton of permissions, including full access to your complete contact list, it is really the most private alternative. Keep in mind, too, that using the manual way will not sync your meetings between Zoom and Calendar for you. If you're okay with that, the following instructions will show you how to add a Zoom invite link to Google Calendar without the add-on:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![calendar link addition meeting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/calendar-link-addition-meeting.jpg)

* Create a new meeting by using the Zoom client on your PC (or Android or iOS phone). Then, on the Meetings page, select the "Copy Invitation" option.
* Open a web browser and log in to Google. After that, enter Google Calendar and manually paste the meeting details into the "Notes" area at the bottom before adding the Zoom invite link. Finally, choose "Save." As previously mentioned, you may now use the email link to add guests and send invitations.
* After accepting the invitation, the participants will see the meeting link in their Google Calendar and be able to join by clicking the link or the "Join Zoom Meeting" option.

### Make a Video Recording of the Call

Zoom's web conferencing call recording as video capability is useful for sharing the conference with individuals who may have missed it or for evaluating the conversation. You must choose either the local or cloud option while recording. Local refers to storing the video file on your own devices, such as your computer or an external storage device.

Use the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) screen recorder for the much simpler experience. With the help of the Filmora screen recorder, users may simultaneously record their screen and camera as well as the audio from their system and microphone. It is possible to preserve any material on Filmora. Screen recording is the best approach to save any pleasure on your monitor. The reach may be captured together with web-based real-time recordings, video chats, and much more using screen recording and video editing tools. You may capture anything on your screen and store it.

### Create Meeting Template

With one URL and preserved settings, create recurring meetings. You may set up a recurring meeting with Zoom for weekly meetings, monthly check-ins, and other regularly scheduled calls. The use of this option has two advantages. First of all, you may set all the call preferences you'd like once and have them remain in effect each time you meet. Second, because repeating calls utilize the same join URL each time, you never need to provide attendees with a new one.

Zoom's web conferencing call recording as video capability is useful for sharing the conference with individuals who may have missed it or for evaluating the conversation. You must choose either the local or cloud option while recording. Local refers to storing the video file on your own devices, such as your computer or an external storage device.

Use the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) screen recorder for the much simpler experience. With the help of the Filmora screen recorder, users may simultaneously record their screen and camera as well as the audio from their system and microphone. It is possible to preserve any material on Filmora. Screen recording is the best approach to save any pleasure on your monitor. The reach may be captured together with web-based real-time recordings, video chats, and much more using screen recording and video editing tools. You may capture anything on your screen and store it.

### Create Meeting Template

With one URL and preserved settings, create recurring meetings. You may set up a recurring meeting with Zoom for weekly meetings, monthly check-ins, and other regularly scheduled calls. The use of this option has two advantages. First of all, you may set all the call preferences you'd like once and have them remain in effect each time you meet. Second, because repeating calls utilize the same join URL each time, you never need to provide attendees with a new one.
