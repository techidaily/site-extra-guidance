The QuickTime player is the primary video playback software built into Mac devices. However, this only supports the native QT format for text in videos during playback and does not accept SRT formatted files.

If you want to know **how to open an SRT file on Mac** via QuickTime Player, the best route is converting the SRT file into QT formatted text. The Caption Converter, for example, is a capable solution for this process, with zero downloading-related issues**.**

**How can Caption Converter alter SRT to QT file for QuickTime Player?**

Step1 Open your chosen browser, and search the Caption Converter-Rev tool. Access the site.

Step2 Click on the “Select Caption Files” option and press the “SELECT .SRT FILES” choice in red button form. Add the SRT file(s) you want to edit.

![press the select srt files option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-open-or-edit-srt-on-mac-8.jpg)

Step3 Choose the output format for the file. Choose QT available in the fourth spot.

Step4 After rechecking that you chose the right format, add your email address; you will receive the translated QT formatted file there. Press the Convert button to activate the conversion process.
