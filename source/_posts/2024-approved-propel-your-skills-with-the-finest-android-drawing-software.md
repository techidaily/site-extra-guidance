Becoming a visual communication expert takes years of hard work. Achieving this goal is impossible without spending thousands of hours practicing and polishing your skills. Drawing apps for Android OS enable you to keep practicing your drawing and painting skills whenever you have some free time.

Google Play hosts hundreds of apps that offer at least some drawing and painting features, which can make the search for a drawing app that meets all your needs a total nightmare. That’s the reason why we selected the top ten drawing apps for Android that will enable you to unleash your creativity and turn any idea you have into a beautiful picture you’ll be proud to share with your friends.

## 10 Best Free and Paid Drawing Apps for Android OS

We’ve shortlisted ten drawing apps you can use for anything from casual doodling to creating highly detailed hyper-realistic digital paintings. However, their capabilities and the range of drawing and painting tools they offer varies, which enables you to choose the one that is best suited for your artistic needs. Let’s take a look at what best free and paid drawing apps for Android OS have to offer.

### 1. [ArtRage](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ambientdesign.artrage.playstore&hl=en)

**Price:** $4.99

The versatile set of painting and drawing tools ArtRage app offers includes an Airbrush, a Paint Tube, or Oil Brush among others. There is a variety of settings for each tool that can be easily adjusted to the needs of your project. So, you can use paint thinner to make the paint less thick or increase and decrease the softness of a pencil tip.

Besides the color, each of these drawing and painting tools also adds texture to your images. In addition, ArtRage lets you create as many layers as you want and it grants you access to a broad spectrum of blending options so that you can stack multiple layers on top of each other. All images you create with this drawing app can be exported in JPEG and PNG formats.

![ LayerPaint HD Draw App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/layerpainthd-drawing-app.jpg)

A fully customizable interface, pen pressure, or Wacom tablet support are just a few reasons why LayerPaint HD is among the best drawing apps for Android devices. In addition, you can import PSD files you created in other image processing apps and continue working on them in just a few quick taps.

The large selection of brushes enables you to have complete control over the visual style of the images you’re creating, and the app also lets you use foreground and transparent color brushes. Adding layers to canvas requires a minimum amount of effort and you can change the blend mode or apply effects to each layer you create. Moreover, LayerPaint HD grants you access to a variety of filters that help you make visually striking images.

![RoughAnimator Draw App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roughanimator-animation-app.jpg)

Instead of drawing just one image, you can draw hundreds of images with RoughAnimator from your Smartphone and turn them into action-packed animations. The app’s timeline doesn’t limit the number of layers you can add to each image and it allows you to adjust the length of exposure of each drawing you add to your project. These features enable you to create straight-ahead and pose-to-pose animations effortlessly, while you can also import videos if you want to make a rotoscoping animation. The app supports Samsung S-Pen as well as a number of other pressure-sensitive devices.

RoughAnimator also lets you import audio into a project and lip-sync it to your footage. The resolution and frame rate of your animations are fully customizable so that you can adjust them to your project’s demands. All projects created in this app can be opened in Adobe After Effects, Toon Boom, Adobe Animate, and other animation software products.

**Conclusion**

Producing digital artwork from an Android OS device has never been easier because there are so many different apps that enable you to draw or paint from your tablet or Smartphone. The majority of the drawing apps we included in this article can be used just for fun or for professional purposes.

However, your choice of a drawing app for Android devices depends on your digital drawing and painting skills, since there is no need to opt for an app aimed at professionals if you just want to create doodles.
