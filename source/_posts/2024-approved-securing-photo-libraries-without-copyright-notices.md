## Securing Photo Libraries Without Copyright Notices

Unfortunately, some do not allow you to download stock images without a watermark. This is because of the unique licenses they offer with their content.

## Part1:Why not use stock photos with watermarks?

![watermarks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-1.jpg)

This is because it infringes on the image's copyright, which can land you in legal trouble. In addition, stock photo contributors can choose to include watermarks in their images as a way of copyrighting their work. As such, they can command royalty payments from the stock photograph website and other users who download their images.

In addition, the stock photos watermark informs other users who to contact when they want to use your images for personal and commercial use. Therefore, they can sue you for extra damages if you use their images without purchasing the rights.

Another reason why it is not OK to use stock photos with watermarks for commercial use is that it looks unprofessional. Typically, stock photo watermarks cover the middle of the photo, making it near unusable for potential copyright violators. In addition, using a watermarked stock photo for your messaging can harm your brand. This is because it indicates to your audience that you are cheap and do not appreciate other people's hard work.
