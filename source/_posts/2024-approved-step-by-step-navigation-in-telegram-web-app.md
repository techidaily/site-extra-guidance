## Step-by-Step Navigation in Telegram Web App

Telegram is a convenient way to stay connected with friends and family. The services come with an app that is super-fast, simple, and secure to use. However, most users don't know how to use the Telegram web version.

Then what if you cannot attend your phone while you are working? How to make the most use of the flexibility of the Telegram?

In this article, we'll show you how to take full advantage of the **Telegram Web version,** along with step-by-step instructions to use it correctly. So, let's dig right in!

## Part 1\. What Is Telegram?

Firstly, let's learn more about this useful tool we use every day for communication.

**Compatibility:** As mentioned in the beginning, one of the best advantages of Telegram is that this communication service is compatible with computers, including Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. But this does not mean that the Android and iOS users are not out of luck, as Telegram has a dedicated app for both of these platforms.

However, if you don't want to install Telegram Desktop on your PC, you can use the Telegram web version instead. You can do this in two ways:

* By visiting the Telegram official website and start communicating directly from the browser.
* By installing the [Telegram extension on the Chrome browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram-for-chrome/djjkifoefibfoodilnhkmbhmadbgacni).
