During the export process, InShot offers Resolution, Frame Rate, and Format options to help you set your video quality/size. Additionally, the app has an interactive social sharing feature with which you can share your clip on different social platforms.

**Disadvantages**: In the **InShot app free** version, the stickers library lacks a search option making it difficult to get the desired sticker as you have to scroll through the library to find the right one.

The **Inshot app without watermark** and ads is only available to users who have availed of any of the premium offers. The app also lacks the zoom-in and out feature while editing a picture, making it difficult to see the details closely.
