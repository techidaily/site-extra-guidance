From webpages, windows, media files, menus, objects, to webcams, you can literally capture anything. It supports Mac, Windows PC, Android devices etc. it supports AVI, FLV, MPEG, WMV, MOV, and MKV files and enables you to add shapes, texts, lines, arrows, and stylish effects while editing the captured images. You can even upload images to cloud or social networking sites like Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter etc. The pictures are saved in JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF format on your computer. Automatic video capture at fixed intervals is also supported.

Here comes the guide –

* Now, run the java applet and just hit the camera icon to capture shots.
* See your mouse cursor appear like a blue crosshair. Hold down the mouse and drag to select the parts of the video you wish to shoot. While moving the mouse, you can see that the application window is covered with a blue border. You can capture the window by clicking there.
