## VR game convention and best practice

 It would be very early to call for a perfect convention for the VR game developers, designers as the total numbers of the VR game titles is still under 100\. You can understand!! So far, there is no clear surface but the game developers and designers are trying their best to solve problems by their own. They are sharing their lessons that they have learned while developing first several VR games. Some of the concerns that they are sharing are – interaction patterns, reality-trade-off and fidelity contract in terms of physics rule, affordance and narrative expectations.

 It is quite expected that in future, more and more best practices will converge together with even more advanced research in VR psychology and UX. Hopefully soon this will cause the emergence of some conventions that will put the developers, designers and the players on the same page.
