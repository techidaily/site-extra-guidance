To achieve this, choose the Automation Curve Tool by clicking on the Tool Selector at the top of the Arrangement View. Then, left-click and drag your automation point up or down between the points.

### Method 2: Employ the Fade-Out Tool

The fading-out process has additional option in Logic Pro. An audio track will fade out if the "Fade Out" slider is used. The audio will progressively fade away as a result. Then, to make an audio zone sound exactly like a "Crossfade-out" region, use the "Fade Out" slider. The fade tool offers an even simpler method for creating a fade out. However, keep in mind that this technique is limited to audio files and tracks. You'll be able to see the cross-fade in action after you've applied it.

Step1 Navigate to the Tool Selector located at the Region View's top. Select the Fade Tool by expanding it.

![fade tool logic pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fade-tool-logic-pro.jpg)

Step2 Select the fade tool, then left-click on the beginning point of your fading while still in the appropriate audio zone. Till the conclusion of your fade, drag the mouse.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![region master logic pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/region-master-logic-pro.jpg)

Step3 The "Fade Out" option may also be used to manage how quickly an area fades out. You must first choose an area and then press the "Fade Out" slider to do this. A playhead may regulate a cross-fade depending on the genre of music. The choice is unaffected by this. However, you should utilize the "Fade In" slider if you're employing an audio effect in a video.

### Method 3: Utilize a File Editor

Using the File Editor to modify is another method for fading in Logic Pro X. This technique records audio data directly. If you're manipulating a single audio sample or area without bouncing, this is helpful. Simply choose the "Fade Out" option from the track menu to alter an audio area. To adjust the fade-out area throughout this procedure, you will need to move the playhead back and forth.

Step1 Either hit the E key or click the icon of a button with a pair of scissors in the top left corner of your screen. Drag the start of your fade from where you want it to start on your waveform to where you want it to stop. Choose File from the menu.
