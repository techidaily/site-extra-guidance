### Advanced Video Editing

Video editing also offers an extensive array of options. You can enjoy the talents of the software in stabilizing the video you create. It can play the video in reverse. You can create a vibrant video bursting with color and life with advanced color tuning.

You can easily create a video in a video effect thanks to green screens. This video-in-video effect can set your video creations a cut above the rest. The split-screen effect lets you do more with less.

### Conclusion

The Windows Photos app is packed with exciting new features that make it an excellent in-house editor. Itâ€™s perfect for learning how to add music to video on windows 11\. It comes with a steep learning curve for new users. This might mean users need some time before they can use the app to full effect.

We can see an upgrade from the Windows 10 version of the software. It allows users to do more with the Windows 11 video editor. This is perfectly suited to beginner users. It does not offer the control and fine-tuning offered by Wondershare Filmora.

Filmora is easier to learn, more powerful. It's packed with advanced features that make it better for professionals and amateurs alike.
