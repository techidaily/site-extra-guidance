 This is another very exciting shooting game plotted in the year 2044\. During this time people tend to lose their spirit because of an unknown virus attack named lethargy. The virus soon goes out of control and in such a situation the International Disease Research Center creates a nanomachine that can attack the virus at its source.

 The name of the machine is Motivator that can restore the spirit in the mankind. The success of the mission solely depends on the piloting skill of yours. This is an action game and is already gaining popularity. Blue Print Inc. is the developer of this game. A truly skilled pilot is very much in demand.

You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories.
