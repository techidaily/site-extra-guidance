## Part 1\. Why a smartphone instead of a regular camera?

Vlogging is a social and creative endeavor that can quickly empty your money account. The expenditures can escalate more easily and quickly than anticipated, from pricey cameras to almost required extras like tripods, external mics, and even light settings to make your vlog look professional. But if you don't want it to, vlogging doesn't have to empty your bank account.

In fact, it's advised against spending a lot of money on a camera when you first start out. We almost all own smartphones. Nowadays' smartphones are smarter and more sophisticated than ever, with many of them featuring the same hardware and software as some high-end DSLR cameras. The majority of 2022 flagships already support 4k recording. Guess what, though? Even many genuine cameras are unable to do that.

Your smartphone, the same gadget you use to text, call, and engage in "social media," may really provide you additional alternatives for something you carry about with you all day. The fact that your smartphone is always with you is one advantage of utilizing it to vlog.

Even slim mirrorless cameras need a separate pocket to be carried because they can take up a lot of carrying space compared to DSLRs. Since you already have a phone on you at all times, using it to vlog can save you money and valuable space. With that said, let's look at some of the best phones for video blogs you can buy this year in-depth reviews.

Over the course of several days, we investigated and evaluated over 20 possibilities in order to assist you in finding the best phones for vlogging. We identified the most important qualities and capabilities to take into account when it comes to especially vlogging during our investigation. For this reason, we advise you to opt for a smartphone with a camera that can produce stunning, clear, and detailed still photographs as well as high- definition films. The top smartphones for vlogging can capture 4K video at up to 60 frames per second. To ensure that you never have to worry about breaking your phone when filming on the go, you should also seek for a phone with a long battery life, brilliant displays, and additional durability.

### Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra

There is no denying that the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra has one of the most sophisticated cameras available for a smartphone. The Galaxy S20 Ultra is tough to top with a really cutting-edge 108-megapixel sensor, 10x lossless zoom capability, and mind-blowing 100x digital zoom (dubbed as Space Zoom). It can record vlogging videos in stunning 8K resolution at 24 frames per second for incredibly detailed, bright, and colorful content.

However, its zooming powers are where it really excels. The 10x lossless zoom on the S20 Ultra delivers the best performance, but the Space Zoom can be a little more challenging to use because it records all of your natural hand movements. We advise mounting your phone on a tripod if you want to use Space Zoom.

Other cutting-edge features and functionality that you should have come to anticipate from flagship smartphones for vlogging are offered by the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. It has an inbuilt storage capacity of 128GB, and upgrades are available if you require more space. A fantastic 120Hz display is also included, and it looks simply amazing.

Plus, you often receive a lengthy battery life with a huge 5000 mAh battery. Nevertheless, the S20 Ultra is loaded with extra functions that, depending on which ones you activate, may result in variable battery efficiency. This phone is tough with IP68 water and dust protection, but it's thicker and heavier than other phones for vlogging, so for the most comfortable experience, you might want to use it with a selfie stick or handheld gimbal. It also ranks among our top 5G smartphones.

### Huawei P30 Pro

The Huawei P30 Pro is designed incredibly well, inside, and out. It features a snappy Kirin 980 processor that keeps everything running smoothly. Plus, it also offers IP68 dust and water resistance for added durability. The curved, 6.47-inch display looks great, and the metal chassis feels premium in your hands. We were impressed that the P30’s display was made from Corning Gorilla Glass so it’s more scratch and shatter-resistant than many other phones.

The gradient coloring on the back of the phone looks stunning, as well. All in all, you can feel good about

holding this phone in your hands while vlogging. It’s definitely sure to catch some eyes. When it comes to user- friendliness, you’ll also be pleased. The user interface, called EMUI, isn’t the best out there, but it’s still simple and easy to use. Plus, the P30 Pro features a super-fast fingerprint reader built directly into the display, which is better than many of the Android competitors.

However, where the Huawei P30 Pro shines even more than its design is in its quad-camera array. Offering

three cameras on the back (40MP + 20MP + 8MP) and one on the front (32MP), you’ll be able to capture any shot you need, in virtually any scenario. However, even better than resolution quality, the P30 offers a telephoto lens with 10x lossless optical zoom and an integrated AI that improves image quality by smoothing any blur from natural hand movements.

The phone can shoot video at 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, so you’ll always get the sharpest video around. We were impressed by Huawei’s Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), as well. It uses that same AI to stabilize your shots – in both video and still images – which is really helpful overall. It’s one of the best Chinese smartphones on our list.

### Google Pixel 6

A second 12MP ultrawide camera with a 114-degree viewing angle is there in addition to the enormous 50MP wide-angle primary camera with optical image stabilization. Both Full HD (1080p) and 4K at 60 frames per second are supported for video output.

The battery is a non-removable Lithium-Ion 4,614 mAh battery pack that enables fast charging and quick wireless charging and has a runtime of little more than 20 hours. The Google Pixel 6 has 128GB or 256GB of storage, which appears to have become the norm given that the majority of smartphones have the same amount of storage.

The CPU is an Octa-core Google Tensor processor (5nm), which has an incorporated GPU and a top clock speed of over 2.2GHz. For $799 for the 128GB model and $899 for the 256GB model, the Google Pixel 6 is offered on Amazon. Still less expensive and just as effective as an iPhone!

### Moto G7 Power

The Moto G7 Power is the ideal choice for new vloggers to break into the industry because it is exceptionally cost-effective while yet providing a ton of functionality and performance. The fact that the Moto G7 Power offers a ton of high-end photography features without charging more may be the thing that surprises people the most. It can still shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second, for instance.

Both the video and static photos have decent quality. You can even film in 1080p at 60 frames per second if you prefer a faster frame rate. The G7 Power comes incredibly close to high-end photo image quality, yet it still falls short. Additionally, the Moto G7 Power has an excellent overall design. Although it is a little heavier and larger than comparable models, the phone's extra-large battery is also its main selling point. The monster 5000 mAh battery is capable of providing a battery life of up to two days.

### Apple iPhone XS

The iPhone XS, like all Apple iPhones, is the result of years of tweaking and improvement, resulting in yet another fantastic product that performs well for both vlogging and regular use. The camera on the XS is an upgrade over the model from the previous generation. A single 7MP camera is on the front, while there are two 12MP cameras on the rear. Nonetheless, pictures and movies are more vibrant than ever before, largely because of the new Smart HDR feature.

Additionally, the sensor admits lighter than ever before. Additionally, the camera is now able to capture 4K video at a frame-per-second rate. The videos are sharp and beautifully detailed as a result. The XS's Portrait mode, which lets you change the depth of focus for a more artistic appearance, also particularly impressed us. Overall, despite the absence of Apple's new Night Mode, which is present on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12, the XS performs admirably while recording in low light.

The iPhone XS maintains a high standard of design quality and usability in accordance with Apple's customary design guidelines. It has a sizable 5.85-inch display with beveled edges. Super Retina XDR, an OLED display with more brightness and detail, is the name of the display technology. The iPhone XS has good toughness against drops and impacts, IP68 water and dust resistance, and other durable features.

The iPhone does not offer any form of expandable storage but is available in a range of storage capacities from 64GB to 512GB. A pricier model will be required if you require additional storage. With the iPhone XS, battery life is respectable. Normal use should allow you to use it for the majority of the day but capturing a 4K video may cause the batteries to deplete more quickly. Therefore, if you plan to vlog all day, we suggest bringing the finest portable charge

### Oppo Reno6 Pro 5G

Due to its great functionality for recording videos, the Reno6 Pro 5G is the ideal tool for vloggers. You can record portrait movies thanks to Oppo's Bokeh Flare Portrait Video mode, which is powered by AI intelligence. By enabling you to blur out the undesired subjects in the backdrop, this function will be very helpful considering that you will be vlogging outside most of the time.

A Live HDR option has also been added to Reno6 Pro 5G, which enhances the ambient light in your films and provides you with additional information. And if that weren't enough, the Ultra Night Video option uses AI technologies to increase brightness while adding extra glitz and context to your recordings. Focus tracking ensures that the main topic of your video is always in focus and shown with exceptional clarity. The brain behind all this filming prowess is the primary 64MP rear camera.

### Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G

The newest flip phone from Samsung is also on our list because it provides you with something unique. And we're not just referring to form factor. On this gadget, even the camera features have been adjusted to function. Dual 12-megapixel rear cameras on the Galaxy Z Flip3 5G allow for both wide- and ultra-angle photography. The most inventive thing Samsung has done is to use the front cover screen as a viewfinder when taking selfies with the rear cameras. This not only produces superior images but also enables you to photograph from various angles and include more subjects in the picture.

Due to the Flex Mode that enables hands-free shooting, the innovation also trickles down to the front camera. Just change the frame's angle before capturing the picture or recording. Additionally, the phone has an automatic framing mechanism that keeps the photo in the middle even when the subjects are moving. Yes, the Galaxy Z Flip3's Nighttime Lapse feature, which provides you with moving images even for shaky films, is another must-try choice. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 is one of the greatest vlogging smartphones on the market right now because to its adaptable design and excellent cameras.

### Mi 11X Pro 5G

Although the Mi 11X Pro 5G is a mid-range flagship, there isn't much in its feature set to imply otherwise. With its ultra-wide, macro, and triple-rear 108MP sensor, vloggers may make amazing vlogs with the necessary adaptability. The numerous capabilities that the Mi 11X Pro offers give it quite a punch when it comes to videos.

The camera has capabilities like time-freeze for cinematic effects, magic zoom to give your content a unique sparkle, and more. When you are photographing in poor light, the slow shutter is a useful bonus. You get excellent results as a result of the feature's effect.

Everyone enjoys taking time-lapse videos, and the Mi 11X Pro elevates the genre with night support. The ideal would be to capture the skyline at night with the moonlight. Additional features include an upside-down parallel world mode and time-freeze video. Additionally, the audio zoom option that expands the audio in your movie deserves special note.

## Part 2\. What lighting do you need?

There is no one-size-fits-all approach because every YouTube content creator has a unique style, from unfiltered vlogs to elaborate studio settings. A compact, portable, light-weight choice would probably work best for you if you frequently film on the go. You should look for a light that can be powered by batteries and possibly one that can connect to your phone or camera directly. Particularly effective here are ring lights and small LED panels.

Moving up, you might prefer a mains-powered light if you're working in a temporary studio outside of your home. Larger LED panel lights are ideal since they provide respectable levels of brightness while yet being able to collapse after filming. Larger diameter ring lights are also a wonderful option to consider because they may provide excellent one-light coverage and can illuminate objects from all angles.

A more substantial studio-style light may be more appropriate for more permanent sets since you won't likely be as concerned about portability. The highest output and the widest selection of light modifiers and accessories are typically found in studio lights, allowing you to customize the light to meet your unique requirements. However, they frequently call for bigger supports and heavier diffusers, which means they will require more room to set up.

The type of light and how you intend to utilize it will affect the brightness level that you should choose for your video light. Most video lights identify their approximate brightness in lumens, with 800 lumens being roughly equivalent to a 60-watt incandescent lightbulb and 1500 lumens being roughly equivalent to a 100-watt bulb.

You'll have more versatility and be able to record your films at a lower ISO for smoother footage if the light is brighter and dimmable. Though brighter lights are frequently heavier and more expensive, it can occasionally be just as effective to place a dimmer light a little bit closer to your subject.

You should be on the lookout for a light's color rendering index, or CRI rating, when working with images or videos. To achieve accurate skin tones, you must know how true to life the colors will appear when enlightened by the light. This information is provided by the CRI. The better the rating, although any light that has a rating of 90 or greater should function just fine.

The color temperature of the light is particularly crucial if you intend to use mixed lighting. You've probably observed that although interior light can appear warm and yellow, brilliant sunshine can feel chilly and blue. The majority of video lights come pre-set with a daylight color temperature, or a kelvin value of about 5500K. Purchasing only daylight-balanced lights will work well if you intend to capture using only specialized video lights.

However, you'll need a light that can be tuned to 3200K or a tungsten setting in order to match the warmer indoor lighting if you're planning on filming with a combination of video lights and conventional incandescent lights.

## Part 3\. What recording settings do you need?

The iPhone 6s and later models can capture 4K video. iPhone 6s/7 (Plus) support 4K at 30 frames per second. The iPhone 8 and later models can capture 4K films at 24, 30, and 60 frames per second. Use 4K instead of 1080p if you don't mind a bigger file size and prefer a sharper image. When it comes to the iPhone's 4K recording settings, it's all about frame rate. Which among 4K 24 fps, 4K 30 fps, and 4K 60 fps should you choose?

You must consider your own use case. Smoother motion results from a higher frame rate. If you want Ultra HD visuals to be smoother, 60FPS is preferable. Setting your iPhone to record video in 4K UHD 60 frames per second has the drawback of requiring additional light. When uploading iPhone 4K UHD footage to YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or any other social networking site, 30fps is a smart option. Videos shot with 24 frames per second are cinematic. In actuality, the difference between 4K 24 fps and 4K 30 fps isn't that noticeable.

The fundamental idea is that setting up a YouTube channel and starting to video doesn't actually require much. If you're on a tight budget, you can get by with just your phone and upgrade when you feel like starting to take things a little more seriously.

One method to stack the deck in your favor and give yourself the best chance of success on YouTube is to purchase more expensive equipment. Starting is not necessary. If you're interested in this kind of thing, feel free to check out the equipment I use on my YouTube channel.

Joining a live cohort where you can learn the methods, tactics, and resources that made previous YouTubers successful is another fantastic strategy to stack the deck in your favor. If you think this sounds like fun, I operate a part-time YouTuber Academy where I show people how to build methods to grow their channel from zero to over 50,000 subscribers and turn it into a dependable source of revenue.

The CPU is an Octa-core Google Tensor processor (5nm), which has an incorporated GPU and a top clock speed of over 2.2GHz. For $799 for the 128GB model and $899 for the 256GB model, the Google Pixel 6 is offered on Amazon. Still less expensive and just as effective as an iPhone!

### Moto G7 Power

The Moto G7 Power is the ideal choice for new vloggers to break into the industry because it is exceptionally cost-effective while yet providing a ton of functionality and performance. The fact that the Moto G7 Power offers a ton of high-end photography features without charging more may be the thing that surprises people the most. It can still shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second, for instance.

Both the video and static photos have decent quality. You can even film in 1080p at 60 frames per second if you prefer a faster frame rate. The G7 Power comes incredibly close to high-end photo image quality, yet it still falls short. Additionally, the Moto G7 Power has an excellent overall design. Although it is a little heavier and larger than comparable models, the phone's extra-large battery is also its main selling point. The monster 5000 mAh battery is capable of providing a battery life of up to two days.

### Apple iPhone XS

The iPhone XS, like all Apple iPhones, is the result of years of tweaking and improvement, resulting in yet another fantastic product that performs well for both vlogging and regular use. The camera on the XS is an upgrade over the model from the previous generation. A single 7MP camera is on the front, while there are two 12MP cameras on the rear. Nonetheless, pictures and movies are more vibrant than ever before, largely because of the new Smart HDR feature.

Additionally, the sensor admits lighter than ever before. Additionally, the camera is now able to capture 4K video at a frame-per-second rate. The videos are sharp and beautifully detailed as a result. The XS's Portrait mode, which lets you change the depth of focus for a more artistic appearance, also particularly impressed us. Overall, despite the absence of Apple's new Night Mode, which is present on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12, the XS performs admirably while recording in low light.

The iPhone XS maintains a high standard of design quality and usability in accordance with Apple's customary design guidelines. It has a sizable 5.85-inch display with beveled edges. Super Retina XDR, an OLED display with more brightness and detail, is the name of the display technology. The iPhone XS has good toughness against drops and impacts, IP68 water and dust resistance, and other durable features.

The iPhone does not offer any form of expandable storage but is available in a range of storage capacities from 64GB to 512GB. A pricier model will be required if you require additional storage. With the iPhone XS, battery life is respectable. Normal use should allow you to use it for the majority of the day but capturing a 4K video may cause the batteries to deplete more quickly. Therefore, if you plan to vlog all day, we suggest bringing the finest portable charge

### Oppo Reno6 Pro 5G

Due to its great functionality for recording videos, the Reno6 Pro 5G is the ideal tool for vloggers. You can record portrait movies thanks to Oppo's Bokeh Flare Portrait Video mode, which is powered by AI intelligence. By enabling you to blur out the undesired subjects in the backdrop, this function will be very helpful considering that you will be vlogging outside most of the time.

A Live HDR option has also been added to Reno6 Pro 5G, which enhances the ambient light in your films and provides you with additional information. And if that weren't enough, the Ultra Night Video option uses AI technologies to increase brightness while adding extra glitz and context to your recordings. Focus tracking ensures that the main topic of your video is always in focus and shown with exceptional clarity. The brain behind all this filming prowess is the primary 64MP rear camera.

### Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G

The newest flip phone from Samsung is also on our list because it provides you with something unique. And we're not just referring to form factor. On this gadget, even the camera features have been adjusted to function. Dual 12-megapixel rear cameras on the Galaxy Z Flip3 5G allow for both wide- and ultra-angle photography. The most inventive thing Samsung has done is to use the front cover screen as a viewfinder when taking selfies with the rear cameras. This not only produces superior images but also enables you to photograph from various angles and include more subjects in the picture.

Due to the Flex Mode that enables hands-free shooting, the innovation also trickles down to the front camera. Just change the frame's angle before capturing the picture or recording. Additionally, the phone has an automatic framing mechanism that keeps the photo in the middle even when the subjects are moving. Yes, the Galaxy Z Flip3's Nighttime Lapse feature, which provides you with moving images even for shaky films, is another must-try choice.

With its ultra-wide, macro, and triple-rear 108MP sensor, vloggers may make amazing vlogs with the necessary adaptability. The numerous capabilities that the Mi 11X Pro offers give it quite a punch when it comes to videos.

## Part 2\. What lighting do you need?

There is no one-size-fits-all approach because every YouTube content creator has a unique style, from unfiltered vlogs to elaborate studio settings. A compact, portable, light-weight choice would probably work best for you if you frequently film on the go. You should look for a light that can be powered by batteries and possibly one that can connect to your phone or camera directly. Particularly effective here are ring lights and small LED panels.

Moving up, you might prefer a mains-powered light if you're working in a temporary studio outside of your home. Larger LED panel lights are ideal since they provide respectable levels of brightness while yet being able to collapse after filming. Larger diameter ring lights are also a wonderful option to consider because they may provide excellent one-light coverage and can illuminate objects from all angles.

A more substantial studio-style light may be more appropriate for more permanent sets since you won't likely be as concerned about portability. The highest output and the widest selection of light modifiers and accessories are typically found in studio lights, allowing you to customize the light to meet your unique requirements. However, they frequently call for bigger supports and heavier diffusers, which means they will require more room to set up.

The type of light and how you intend to utilize it will affect the brightness level that you should choose for your video light. Most video lights identify their approximate brightness in lumens, with 800 lumens being roughly equivalent to a 60-watt incandescent lightbulb and 1500 lumens being roughly equivalent to a 100-watt bulb.

You'll have more versatility and be able to record your films at a lower ISO for smoother footage if the light is brighter and dimmable. Though brighter lights are frequently heavier and more expensive, it can occasionally be just as effective to place a dimmer light a little bit closer to your subject.

You should be on the lookout for a light's color rendering index, or CRI rating, when working with images or videos. To achieve accurate skin tones, you must know how true to life the colors will appear when enlightened by the light. This information is provided by the CRI. The better the rating, although any light that has a rating of 90 or greater should function just fine.

The color temperature of the light is particularly crucial if you intend to use mixed lighting. You've probably observed that although interior light can appear warm and yellow, brilliant sunshine can feel chilly and blue. The majority of video lights come pre-set with a daylight color temperature, or a kelvin value of about 5500K. Purchasing only daylight-balanced lights will work well if you intend to capture using only specialized video lights.

However, you'll need a light that can be tuned to 3200K or a tungsten setting in order to match the warmer indoor lighting if you're planning on filming with a combination of video lights and conventional incandescent lights.

## Part 3\. What recording settings do you need?

The iPhone 6s and later models can capture 4K video. iPhone 6s/7 (Plus) support 4K at 30 frames per second. The iPhone 8 and later models can capture 4K films at 24, 30, and 60 frames per second. Use 4K instead of 1080p if you don't mind a bigger file size and prefer a sharper image. When it comes to the iPhone's 4K recording settings, it's all about frame rate. Which among 4K 24 fps, 4K 30 fps, and 4K 60 fps should you choose?

You must consider your own use case. Smoother motion results from a higher frame rate. If you want Ultra HD visuals to be smoother, 60FPS is preferable. Setting your iPhone to record video in 4K UHD 60 frames per second has the drawback of requiring additional light. When uploading iPhone 4K UHD footage to YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or any other social networking site, 30fps is a smart option. Videos shot with 24 frames per second are cinematic. In actuality, the difference between 4K 24 fps and 4K 30 fps isn't that noticeable.

The fundamental idea is that setting up a YouTube channel and starting to video doesn't actually require much. If you're on a tight budget, you can get by with just your phone and upgrade when you feel like starting to take things a little more seriously.

One method to stack the deck in your favor and give yourself the best chance of success on YouTube is to purchase more expensive equipment. Starting is not necessary. If you're interested in this kind of thing, feel free to check out the equipment I use on my YouTube channel.

Joining a live cohort where you can learn the methods, tactics, and resources that made previous YouTubers successful is another fantastic strategy to stack the deck in your favor. If you think this sounds like fun, I operate a part-time YouTuber Academy where I show people how to build methods to grow their channel from zero to over 50,000 subscribers and turn it into a dependable source of revenue.
