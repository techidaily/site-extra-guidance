## Part 2: How to Make Text Move in Windows 10 Photos App

The Photos app in Windows 10 is even easier than the old Windows Movie Maker. You do not need a sharp learning curve for using this app and any beginner can use it with ease and comfort. The Photos app has an anchoring system along with the text tool that makes the text move with the video images. Here’s how you can make the text move in Windows 10 Photos app-

* Open the Photos app
* At the top, you can find “Create” option in blue color and choose it. From the drop-down menu, select the custom video with the music option. At the top right corner of the video, check the box you wish to edit
* Click on Add and drag the video to the timeline below. Go to the effects menu and click 3D effects
* On the right, find the effects sidebar and select any effect that you find suitable for your video text

* Pin the slider in Attach to a point at the On position
* To add the 3D moving image, drag the blue anchor to the object you’d like to attach and wait as it process
