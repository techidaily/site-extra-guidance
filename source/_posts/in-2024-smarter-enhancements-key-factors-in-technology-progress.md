Is Windows 10 going to prove to be all it's cracked up to be? Early reviews indicate that it is indeed a fantastic new addition to the Windows family. These early reviews are indicating that Windows 10 is vastly superior to Windows 8\. Initial reviews are leaning towards the consensus that this is the best version of Windows that Microsoft has put out in years.

If you're considering the upgrade, there are a few things you're going to want to learn about first.

* [Is The Upgrade Free?](#free)
* [Reasons To Upgrade](#reasons)
* [What You’ll Leave Behind By Migrating To Windows 10](#leave)
* [When, Where And How To Get Windows 10](#when)
* [Will Windows 10 Expire?](#expire)

#### 1\. Is The Upgrade Free?

The first thing you're probably asking yourself is whether or not the Windows 10 upgrade is free. Relax. It is going to be free, but only under certain conditions. The first condition is that if you want to get Windows 10 free, you better hurry up.

Those who currently have Windows 7, Windows 8.1, or Windows Phone 8.1 will have the option to upgrade to Windows 10 for free at a certain point in time. These users will have a window of one full year from the official release date for Windows 10, which was July 29th. After you claim the upgrade, you will want to note that it will be permanent. Beyond that, Microsoft will continue to keep you in the loop for the supported life span of the product.

Keep in mind that Windows RT tablets will only get certain features, but not the full Windows 10 upgrade. A business user will be required to pay for their upgrade.

Should you need to reinstall Windows 10 at some point, you'll have a product key that will allow you to do so. You may also want to look into making some backup discs.

#### 2\. Reasons To Upgrade

Most of actively despise Windows 8 and 8.1, but at least most of us eventually got used to it. Why should we imagine Windows 10 is going to be that much better?

Instead of holding a grudge, consider these reasons to upgrade to Windows 10 (besides the fact that it's FREE):

* **The start menu** is going to be much, much better than Windows 8 and 8.1: Let's face it: We hate the Windows 8 and 8.1 start menus. Windows 10 is going to bring back the start menu we know and love. The graphics are updated, the tiles are still there, and you have the option to go full-screen. Even so, Windows 10 is already off on the right foot with the start menu.
* **Cortana**: Windows Phone users already know Cortana. PC and tablet users will have the chance to meet this exceptional rival to Siri and Google Now. Saying "Hey Cortana" will bring it to life, and you can edit Cortana's knowledge base about you, in order to improve its efficiency.
* **Universal apps**: If you're planning to use more than one Windows device, you're going to love the fact that Windows 10 will include universal apps. The various apps bundled with Windows 10 will work across varying devices and screen sizes.

These are just three reasons. Don't forget about the Edge browser, the Xbox app and steaming, a variety of enhances, and the intriguing potential of HoloLens.

#### 3\. What You'll Leave Behind By Migrating To Windows 10

Windows 10 is obviously going to bring a lot of cool things to the table. Is it perfect? That's going to depend on how you feel about the following:

* **Windows Media Center will disappear**: The era of Windows 10 will also sound the death knell for Windows Media Center. That means that if you rely on Windows Media Center to utilize your entertainment content, you're going to have to look for another venue.
* **Some of your apps might break**: Microsoft is giving third-party developers plenty of time to work on compatibility. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, some apps are just not going to be able to make the cut. If you're concerned about a certain, check to make sure it's going to be compatible.
* **Your computer is old**: Even if you meet the minimum system requirements, that doesn't mean your Windows 10 experience is going to be optimal. In fact, your overall experience with your device may wind up being worse.

#### 4\. When, Where And How To Get Windows 10

Windows 10 began its most significant push towards complete release on July 29th. Those who reserved a copy are naturally going to be the first ones in line to get it. Microsoft fully intends to roll out the release to all who want it over the coming weeks.

Currently, if your device is eligible, you should see a small Windows logo in your notification area.

#### 5\. Will Windows 10 Expire?

Not. If you download your free Windows 10 upgrade, and you have the product key, it will remain yours until whenever Microsoft ends all support for it. Generally speaking, this will be several years down the road.
