## Top 5 Auto Tracking Camera Mounts 2020

Let’s take a look at the top auto-tracking camera mounts you can buy in 2020.

### 1\. PicBot

If we’re discussing auto-tracking camera mount, PicBot definitely deserves mention. With this mount, in one click, or no clicks at all, you can become a professional visual content creator.

When PicBot offers the features of clicking extensive panoramas, it comes equipped with an object tracking flexible enough for it. This auto-follow camera mount can turn a full circle when capturing videos and a complete left to right when capturing panoramic shots. This auto-tracking feature, however, is limited to **face tracking** and cannot follow inanimate objects.

**Key Features:**

* App Loaded With Features  
Timelapses and panoramas have never been as easy. With loaded features that work completely automatically, you can have your bot capture stunning visuals swiveling around the entire circumference of your landscape and being a steady cameraman for even the longest of time-lapses.
* Bluetooth 4.0 Control

For complete orientation, start-stop, and focus control, PicBot is equipped with a manually operated Bluetooth remote.

* Automatic Still Countdown

When you want to capture yourself sitting back and relaxing, PicBot offers you the option to do that without even pressing a single button. The motion detectors will detect when you’re still for a few seconds and the automatic still countdown will begin, capturing the perfect photo at the end.

**Supported Devices:**

Compatible only with the latest smartphones -- Android 4.3 & above and iOS 7 & above. The optimal weight that this bot can handle is 200g.

**Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating:**
_With 180°/ 360° object tracking._

### 3\. Zhiyun Crane 2

If barrel shots worry you or if the payload has been a problem, Zhiyum Crane 2 comes with features you badly need and ones you didn’t even know you needed.

### 4\. Zhiyun Smooth 4

This one lives up to its tagline, ‘born for the mobile filmmakers’ owing to its superior features that assist you in creating professional content. Being an extremely efficient, precision and speed-driven auto-tracking camera mount, Zhiyun Smooth 4 is definitely a catch. Especially with the jaw-dropping price that it is offered at.

With this auto-follow camera mount, you can be not only hands-free but also worry-free. Although the bot cannot capture a full circle, the sensitivity of tracking is hard to match.

**Key Features:**

* Focus Pull and Zoom

Smooth 4 operates on an inbuilt handwheel configured into a focus puller that makes the experience so smooth. That combined with the powerful Phone Go Mode, whether its zooming or switching focus, the transition will never disrupt the aesthetics with this auto-follow camera mount.

* Lapses and Slo-Mos

Why limit to time-lapses when you can capture motion-lapse and hyper-lapses as well as detailed slow motions? These lapses are further complemented with the wide-range and triaxial modes to capture unbelievably artistic shots.

**Supported Devices:**

Compatible with all phones and accessories like LED lights and camera lenses.

**Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating: 4.5/5**
_With 200° tilt and 300° pan object tracking._

**Pricing: $99**

### 5\. PivoPod

Gone are the days you needed to rely on remotes only to forget where you left them. Train your PivoPod (by feeding them voice and gesture data) and simply have it follow your commands anywhere, anytime.
