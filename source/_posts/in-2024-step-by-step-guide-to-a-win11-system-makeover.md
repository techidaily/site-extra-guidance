## Part 3: How to Install and Upgrade to Windows 11?

Want to know the simplest way of how to install Windows 11? This article will give you a brief guideline to download Windows 11 without any systematic bugs and issues. To make it easier for you, we are providing two methods on how to get Windows 11.

Method 1: How to Install Official Windows 11 Instantly?

Before making any steps, make sure that your PC meets minimum Windows 11 requirements as mentioned above.

Step 1: Download Windows 11 Installation Package

Before making any certain changes to your device, it is important to upgrade your device. In this way, the installation will smoothly take place. You need to proceed into the "Download Windows 11" [official Microsoft webpage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) option for upgrading the device’s status. For installing the Windows 11 update, click on the "Download Now" option and follow the instructions.

![download windows 11 update ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upgrade-to-windows-11-in-2021-7.jpg)

Step 2: Get Windows 11 Installation Media

There is another option available for you to install Windows 11 on another PC. For this, go to the heading of "Create Windows 11 Installation Media" and select "Download Now."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![download windows 11 installation media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upgrade-to-windows-11-in-2021-8.jpg)

Step 3: Boot your USB for Installation

For this step, you will need a USB of 8GB. Make sure that your USB does not contain any significant data, as this installation will remove all files. After following the instructions of the "Media Creation Tool," insert USB into the PC and then restart your computer.

![make your usb windows 11 bootable](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upgrade-to-windows-11-in-2021-9.jpg)

Step 4: Initiate Boot Process

To install the Windows 11 from your installed disk, you are required to get the computer to boot from the USB you have plugged. For this, when the manufacturer logo pops up on the screen, press F12 or F2 to go on the boot menu. Then select where you want to boot on USB and press the "Enter" key. Windows 11 will start installing afterward.

Method 2: How to Get Windows 11 Future Updates from Windows Insider Program?

Another easiest and reliable way to get Windows 11 future updates is through the Windows Insider Program. Users cannot access the Android apps across the Microsoft Store in Windows 11 before 2022, as the official release date of these applications mention the next year as a probable release year. You can only access these apps after their official launch.

However, if you have joined the Insider Program, the platform helps you in downloading these applications beforehand.

Step 1: Access Windows Insider Program Website

Go to [Microsoft's website](https://insider.windows.com/) and join the Windows Insider Program by registering over there.

![join the windows 11 insider program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upgrade-to-windows-11-in-2021-10.jpg)

If you are unable to find Microsoft’s website, there is an alternate method. You can still find the Windows insider program through Windows 11\. The user needs to go through the "Start Menu" for accessing the "Settings" option from the list.
