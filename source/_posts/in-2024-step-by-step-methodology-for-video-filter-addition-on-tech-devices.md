##### Step2 Select your Choice of Filter

Please hover your mouse over to the filter effects you want to use, you will see a plus icon at the middle-click on it, and then the Effect will get added to your Timeline.

Drag and drop the filter onto the video clip already on the Timeline so that the Effect can automatically apply to the whole video.

##### Step3 For Editing Portrait

Please note that if you are editing a portrait (9:16) filter in a 16:9 video clip, add a blue filter background to replace the black bars.

##### Step4 Save and Export Final Video

Once you finish adding filters, use the Export button to save the video by selecting the destination and share with your friends.

Finally, you know how to put a filter to a video with Filmora, an easy-to-do software.
