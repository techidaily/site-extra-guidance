### 1\. Remove Background

The background of your image is an integral part of the portrait as it facilitates grabbing the viewer’s attention. While capturing a picture, it is possible that there are some unnecessary objects or people in the frame. Or, in some cases, the background looks dull and ruins the whole image. Canva has introduced its background remover, through which you can quickly erase the background of your picture.

Moreover, you can design or choose pre-made background templates on this tool to add a vibrant and creative background. Thus, an eye-catchy background on your pictures can make a good impression of yours. Isn’t it great?

### 2\. Apply Filters by Quick Search

Every photo editor consists of filters and effects to make ordinary photos look attractive. Just like other photo editors, Canva photo editor also has its exclusive filters that range in various options such as summer glow, natural tint, and many more. You can adjust the intensity of filters with your fingers and can manage their brightness, saturation, contrast, and tint effects.

Other interesting effects include BadTV, through which you can add cinematic and vintage effects to your photos by exploring different options. Thus, enhance and beautify your photos with a few swipes, and you can confidently post them across social media platforms. You should try it!
