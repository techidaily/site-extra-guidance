We feel that this way to insert Audio into PowerPoint is pretty creative than using the PowerPoint itself with the lengthy steps. After doing all the adding and recording of Audio on Wondershare Filmora, you can export the project and add its whole presentation. Thus, there's no need to add extra elements and editing tools in the PowerPoint presentation, which could be tricky for an amateur.
