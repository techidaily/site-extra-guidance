## Integrating Podcast Magic: A Step-by-Step for iPhone Users

Podcasts are the new 'it' thing many creators are getting into, and audiences focus on for content consumption. Thus, many users **download Apple Podcasts,** given the vast library of content available in its repertoire. The shows cover various topics and subjects, and major businesses and influencers use the platform to promote their audio-based projects.

However, as the name suggests, Apple Podcasts is available to a niche group, i.e., iOS users mainly with Apple IDs. So, how to download the episodes and listen? All are covered here.

## Part 1\. Are Apple Podcasts Free to Download?

One of the first points of concern for users when it comes to **Apple Podcasts how to download** is the cost of the app itself. On that note, it is important to mention that the app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch users is free to access. Lots of different shows are available for cost-less listening.

However, some of the podcasters with shows on Apple Podcasts do offer premium episodes, shows, and channels. People can subscribe to their channels with a specified fee that the creator sets on a monthly or yearly payment schedule.

Users that want to access these premium/bonus episodes, ad-free listening, get faster access to their archives and get a first look at new shows can opt for the subscription. The costs can vary as per the channels, with some offering a 7-day trial and USD 3.99 per month or other offers.

## Part 2\. How to Download Apple Podcasts on an iPhone/iPad

If you want access to free episodes or subscribe to the premium channel memberships, you must know **how to download apple podcasts.** The steps can vary for device types, like iPod Touch or iPhone. Let's discuss the steps involved.

### Issue 1: Temporary glitches

Sometimes, the main reason why users cannot download their Apple podcasts on the app is due to some temporary glitches. They are not easy to detect or prevent, but the issue itself is relatively low on the danger scale. However, it can suddenly stop some apps from operating, like the Podcast app.

### Issue 3: Not connecting to or unavailable Wi-Fi

Step1 On your device, click on Settings. Then, choose the Podcasts option.

Step2 Check if the Cellular Data access is active on the app. If not, enable it.

### Issue 4: Bad network connection error

Sometimes, the main cause of the failure to download Apple podcast episodes occurs due to connection issues directly. In this case, users continuously notice problems while trying to download their Podcasts app.

**Fix: Reset the network settings**

You should change your network settings completely to resolve this issue. You will not lose any available data. However, the process involves setting up the Wi-Fi connections fully from the ground-up, so follow the instructions on the screen very carefully.

### Issue 3: Not connecting to or unavailable Wi-Fi

It is better to choose other networks for users who are not using an active Wi-Fi connection, or the connection is not stable. Allow permissions for accessing the cellular data in your device to the Podcast app instead.

**Fix: Choose cellular data instead**

The steps for activating Cellular data access permission are as follows:

Step1 On your device, click on Settings. Then, choose the Podcasts option.

Step2 Check if the Cellular Data access is active on the app. If not, enable it.

Step3 Disable the "Block Downloads Over Cellular" option if already enabled.

### Issue 4: Bad network connection error

Sometimes, the main cause of the failure to download Apple podcast episodes occurs due to connection issues directly. In this case, users continuously notice problems while trying to download their Podcasts app.

**Fix: Reset the network settings**

You should change your network settings completely to resolve this issue. You will not lose any available data. However, the process involves setting up the Wi-Fi connections fully from the ground-up, so follow the instructions on the screen very carefully.

Go to the Settings menu on your iPhone device and click on the General option. Then, press the Reset option and choose the Reset Network Settings selection.

### Issue 5: App issue

In some cases, the main reason why the podcast downloading process is not working is due to a defect in the app. In this situation, the best solution is to offload the Podcasts app and reinstall it properly.

**Fix: Offloading and Re-downloading Apple Podcasts**

The following steps are important to follow here:

Step1 Go to the Settings menu from your device.

Step2 Click on the General option and choose iPhone Storage. Then, go to Podcasts.

Step3 Under this section, click on the Offload App button.

Step4 Return to the Home screen and choose the Podcasts app to re-download.

## Final Words

It is possible to download the Apple Podcasts easily and then download the episodes you subscribe to for offline listening. However, if you cannot download the app or episodes due to a network or software issue, use the right steps to fix them. Understand both sides of the downloading process and experience to make your choice in using it.
