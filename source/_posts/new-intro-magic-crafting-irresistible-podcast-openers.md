## What Is a Podcast Description?

![podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-write-amazing-podcast-descriptions-1.jpg)

A podcast description is like a book summary, giving readers an idea of the book. Also, the podcast description usually highlights keywords and some takeaways for listeners.

### Critical points of a podcast description

1. A podcast description, also known as a podcast summary, can be viewed in the Podcast's RSS feed.
2. A podcast description remains the same for every Podcast and it's usually about the hosting site in general.
3. On the other hand, the show notes or podcast episode descriptions are more focused on describing what to expect in the latest episode.
4. A podcast description is like the face of the Podcast, acting as a determinant of the success of your channel.

You might think, "There's an intro in the Podcast itself. Why would I need a podcast description." If there's any other query related to the Podcast's importance, clear it here you go.

## Why Does a Podcast Description Matter?

Usually, the title of the Podcast alone is not enough, and a description is needed, so the listener gets to know what the Podcast is about.

![podcast description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-write-amazing-podcast-descriptions-2.jpg)

A podcast description functions as a key to the lock. Just as there is no knowing what lies in a box without opening it first, a listener cannot decide without reading the podcast description first.

A podcast description acts as an icebreaker for prospective listeners. A new listener frequently lacks dedication to your channel and hesitates about whether your Podcast is worth his time. Besides, a well-written podcast description often ends up enticing the straying audience.

### A podcast description matters because of the following elements

**● It gives the listener an insight into the podcast**

![podcast listener](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-write-amazing-podcast-descriptions-3.jpg)

Most importantly, a podcast description gives the listener insight into the show and what they may expect from your podcast. It includes relevant keywords, although it is not significant for search engine optimization.

**● Grasps the interest of the targeted audience**

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![podcast target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-write-amazing-podcast-descriptions-4.jpg)

The podcast description should be written keeping in mind the reader's psyche. Therefore, although a brief description is ideal, it should still be adequate for the reader to form an opinion about the Podcast.

For instance, if your podcast channel focuses on comedy show reviews, it must be highlighted in your description. Again, this will aid in drawing the attention of the target audience.

**● Serves as the identity of your podcasting channel**

![podcasting channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-write-amazing-podcast-descriptions-5.jpg)

Self-introduction is the most important aspect of giving your podcast its unique identity. It also aids in forging a bond between the audience and the host. It enables the listeners to relate better to your content. It also paints a far more vivid picture in the listeners' minds.

Your next thought would be, "How can I write the best-fitting description that will make the reader want to hit the play button almost instantly?"

To comprehend the crux of making the podcast description distinctive and stand out, proceed to the next section of this article.

## What Makes a Podcast Description Stand Out?

A podcast description that would guarantee the reader's full attention should be comprised of the following:

### 1\. The length of the description should be ideal

A podcast description can often vary from 150 to 250 words in total. Some podcast genres, like true crime, may be a little longer, but they should be concise, to the point, and accurate.

### 2\. Repetition of the content can bore the reader

There should be no unnecessary repetition of the topic. It would be best if you always remembered that a podcast description is like a business card for all listeners worldwide. So, prepare a decent one for no matter newcomers or familiar faces so that makes your show stands out.

### 3\. The language style should be engaging

Finally, the language should be catchy and appealing to imprint the reader's mind. I know this standard is the most subjective one, but please try to be as fun as possible whenever you engage with listeners.

### ● Self-introduction

"Who is hosting this particular podcast?" is the most common query of almost every listener.

Thus, the most vital step for a podcast description is introducing oneself since the audience is curious to know whom they're listening to.

### ● Target audience

Our audience can vary depending on the content presented in the Podcast. One way to determine the target audience would be to pose a statement, and those who agree to it would be able to relate to your Podcast easily.

Self-introduction is the most important aspect of giving your podcast its unique identity. It also aids in forging a bond between the audience and the host. It enables the listeners to relate better to your content. It also paints a far more vivid picture in the listeners' minds.

Your next thought would be, "How can I write the best-fitting description that will make the reader want to hit the play button almost instantly?"

To comprehend the crux of making the podcast description distinctive and stand out, proceed to the next section of this article.

## What Makes a Podcast Description Stand Out?

A podcast description that would guarantee the reader's full attention should be comprised of the following:

### 1\. The length of the description should be ideal

A podcast description can often vary from 150 to 250 words in total. Some podcast genres, like true crime, may be a little longer, but they should be concise, to the point, and accurate.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Repetition of the content can bore the reader

There should be no unnecessary repetition of the topic. It would be best if you always remembered that a podcast description is like a business card for all listeners worldwide. So, prepare a decent one for no matter newcomers or familiar faces so that makes your show stands out.

### 3\. The language style should be engaging

Finally, the language should be catchy and appealing to imprint the reader's mind. I know this standard is the most subjective one, but please try to be as fun as possible whenever you engage with listeners.

### ● Self-introduction

"Who is hosting this particular podcast?" is the most common query of almost every listener.

Thus, the most vital step for a podcast description is introducing oneself since the audience is curious to know whom they're listening to.

A small introduction of David Pascall, "as the OPR correspondent," can be seen in this description.

### ● What to be expected

After you've introduced yourself, the next thing you should focus on is selecting the format for your Podcast.

As your listeners would be curious to know what format your podcasts would follow. Whether it would showcase an interview or it would be a solo podcast?

### ● Target audience

Our audience can vary depending on the content presented in the Podcast. One way to determine the target audience would be to pose a statement, and those who agree to it would be able to relate to your Podcast easily.

This description specifies the target audience. All those interested in either pop music or fantasy movies would definitely want to listen to this podcast.

### ● The ideal length of the podcast description

The length of the podcast description varies from 150 to 250 words. What should be kept in mind is that it should not be too wordy, or it will fail to fulfill its purpose, i.e., to catch the reader's attention.

Now, look at some trending podcast descriptions to put our theory into practice.
