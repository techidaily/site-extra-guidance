Filmora is Wondershare's entry-level, simple-to-use, high-quality video editing software. 4k and gif support are now standard capabilities for most video editing tools, but titles are something Filmora excels at.

The Filmora video editor now supports true 4k videos (both 3840\*2160 and 4096\*2160), as well as the creation of proxy files for a more fluid video editing experience. In Filmora, you may edit with proxy video files and subsequently export with the full-sized resolution.
