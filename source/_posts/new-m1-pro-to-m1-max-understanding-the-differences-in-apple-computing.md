| **CPU**              | 10-core                          | 10-core                                             |
| **GPU**              | 16-core                          | 24 or 32-core                                       |
| **Battery Life**     | 16 hours                         | 17-21 hours                                         |

| **Performance**      | CPU is 70 percent better than M1 | Advanced video editing, powerful graphic processing |

After going through the above comparison table, it is clear that CPU performance is almost the same for both M1 Pro and M1 Max. The actual difference comes in terms of graphical processing, which is much better than M1 Max.

Battery life is almost the same. Though M1 Max takes some advantage over that of M1 Pro, still, M1 Pro performs far better than that of the M1 version.
