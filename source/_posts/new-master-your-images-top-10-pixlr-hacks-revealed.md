### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays

If you find your image still boring even after adding all the elements, borders, stickers, and drawings, you can apply high-quality effects and overlays to the images within no time.

On the other hand, people like to use the feature of overlays to add extra layers and texture to their images for enhancement.
