If you prefer an outer space dynamic background with titles floating, this is exactly the same. The title floats in outer space in slow motion.

The title is in 3D texture. A graphical object in the shape of the planetary ring has been used for enhancing the effect. Along with those, there is the light dispersion and blurry effect that makes the text stand out.
