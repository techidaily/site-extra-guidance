Step 1: Firstly, open File Explorer and then head over to the folder that contains the pictures that you want for the wallpaper.

Step 2: Now, by right-clicking on the image file, a menu will appear. From that menu, go for the option of 'Set as desktop Background.' This will set your Windows 11 wallpaper.
