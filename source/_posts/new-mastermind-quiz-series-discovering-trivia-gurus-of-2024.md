With Filmora, you can easily add quizzes, graphics, and effects to your video. The software can also record your voiceover or add background music.

Here's how you can make a **general knowledge quiz video** on your own using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):
