### Conclusion

The Windows Photos app is packed with exciting new features that make it an excellent in-house editor. Itâ€™s perfect for learning how to add music to video on windows 11\. It comes with a steep learning curve for new users. This might mean users need some time before they can use the app to full effect.

We can see an upgrade from the Windows 10 version of the software. It allows users to do more with the Windows 11 video editor. This is perfectly suited to beginner users. It does not offer the control and fine-tuning offered by Wondershare Filmora.

Filmora is easier to learn, more powerful. It's packed with advanced features that make it better for professionals and amateurs alike.
