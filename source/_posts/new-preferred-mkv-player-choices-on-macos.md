### 4. MPlayerX

All users of the MacOS system swear by MPlayerX. As a Mac user, you will immediately recognize the sleek OS system design with attractive keys.

 ![mplayerx for mkv files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/mplayerx-for-mkv-files.jpg)

You will truly enjoy working with this MKV player for Mac due to its useful functions. If you ever get interrupted whilst working with the player, it has a memory function that will start the reproduction of the specific file at the same mark that it stopped at.

The player has exceptional organizational functions that rearrange files properly and automatically play the next file.

If you choose to use this player, you will notice that the system tends to crash from time to time more than the other famous media players. Even with the user-friendly look and features, the player does not offer an easy to use playlist feature either.

### 5. DivX Plus

In keeping with the tradition of suggesting you a free MKV player, the last on the list is DivX Plus which is somewhat a diva of the media player world.

 ![divx plus for mkv files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/divx-plus-for-mkv-files.jpg)

It is a media player that does almost everything. With this MKV player for Mac, you will be able to convert your videos, have a web browser plug-in at your hand, and a codec pack too.

The look of it is supremely stylish and the features are easy to grasp and use. A disadvantage that comes to mind is that it is not user-friendly at all when it comes to streaming video options.

#### Conclusion

All the media players listed above are top-notch but you cannot easily trim, cut or crop videos with them. You will need to use a video editing software for your MKV files. One that tops the list is [FilmoraX for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) which will enable you to professionally edit your content in the easiest way possible.
