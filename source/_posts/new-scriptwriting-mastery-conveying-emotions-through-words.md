### **Definition**

The Narrative Script is a story. It consists of the whole narration of the story by the writer. On the other hand, Dialogue Script is the talk between the characters. So you can say that the entire story of the script is Narrative writing and the discussions between characters are Dialogues.

### 1\. Pay attention to the conversations in your real life

One of the best tips for good scripting is to be natural; for it, you can look and take inspiration from your real life. Just note the behavior of people and the progress of the world around you. Record these experiences, which will help you provide a natural touch in your script.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Let each character have its voice and characteristics. Not a second you

Sometimes when we write, we lose our concentration and write all the characters' dialogue in the same way. But it's not good because a good script always has consistency from start to end. You must write each character's dialogues in their own way and expression.

### 3\. No meaningless or only question-and-answer type dialogue

If your dialogue script is only comprised of questions and answers, keep in mind that it won't be very interesting. Moreover, we sometimes compose talks that are meaningless, which is another serious issue. Focus on writing conversation in a balanced manner with meaningful usage to overcome these problems.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Control the rhythm of the conversations

Controlling the conversation is one of the essential tips. Primarily, our actual conversation doesn't complete. It means that we mix it with other dialogues without proper punctuation. Be careful about punctuation while writing conversations.

### 5\. Don't use full sentences that contain too much underlying meaning

Whenever you read something, you'll lose interest in it if the writer uses full and long sentences a lot. Because, in reality, it seems robotic. On the other hand, some writers don't use full sentences and keep them short. Their story seems more interesting because it's a long-established fact that using full sentences, especially in script writing, distracts the audience, and they become bored.

## Part 3\. Best dialogue and narrative examples from movies

Check out the examples below of how great dialogue has impacted movies as an essential component of the script.

### **1\. The Man from Earth**

Professor John Oldman's farewell party turns into a mysterious and interesting debate among colleagues after he asked strange question. It's an audio movie, but probably more like a stage play, that is, a single scene with multiple characters. Everyone gave their opinion on a single issue.

The reason for introducing this movie as the first example is that the screenwriter provided a perfect example. He showed you how to control a debate or discussion in a movie.

### **2\. Before Sunrise**

This movie teaches you how to explore the relationship between two characters in a single scene and through dialogue by focusing on their interaction.

Although sounding cinematically natural, the conversation in the movie is absolutely real. They interrupt each other. Their thoughts follow different paths through different tangents.

### **3\. Pulp Fiction**

Films by Quentin Tarantino are notable for their dialogue. This is because he will not really waste any words when writing. Every word spoken has a function. He builds humor without making jokes. He calmly creates tension before exploding with menacing rage.
