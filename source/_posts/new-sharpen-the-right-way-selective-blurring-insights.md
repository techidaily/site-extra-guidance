1. Once you have chosen the shape, you will see the effect in action. Everything within the center of that shape will stay untouched and in sharp focus. Anything beyond the internal shape will subtly start to fade into a blur.
2. To reshape the outer edges' size of the effect, drag the outer shape outline.
3. When you make the outer shape larger, you'll retain more of your image in focus while reducing the harshness of the blur. You can adjust the outer edges and rotate the outline with your two fingers.

The app also has additional effect shapes for more customization options. You can edit the shape of the effect, from heart, star, circle, and more.

1. Now, right-click on the image, then click Save as Picture. Name your image, and then save it on your PC.

### 3\. Use Built-in Paint Tool

Microsoft Paint is a raster graphics editor included in all the available versions of Microsoft Windows. This simple program can open and save files in single-page TIFF, PNG, GIF, JPEG, and Windows bitmap (BMP) formats. MS Paint doesn't have a direct way of creating blurred effects to pictures; however, you can use some basic techniques to get the blur effect. Remember, once you save your photo with the blur effect, removing it from the image can be challenging. As such, you might want to back up your photos if needed.

1. From the Start menu, launch MS paint.
2. Click on File, then select the Open option. Browse to find the image you want to add blur and click it. Click the Open button to import the image to Microsoft Paint.
3. Under Shapes, click the rectangle tool and single-click on the area you want to blur. Now, Drag the rectangle around that area.

## How to Blur a Part of Picture on Mobile

Sometimes you might want to hide sensitive details in a picture before sharing it with your family members and friends or on social media. Cropping the photo won't be the best solution in these cases. That's why you should learn how to blur part of an image. That said, here are two ways you can blur part of a picture on your mobile device.

### 1\. Use App

You can use a mobile app to blur specific areas in your images. YouCam Perfect is one of the most popular mobile applications compatible with iOS and Android devices. Want to know how to blur part of an image on your mobile devices using YouCam Perfect? Follow the steps below.

1. Download the YouCam Perfect app on Google Play or the Apple App Store and install it on your device.

![blur a part of image on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-part-of-an-image-12.png)

1. Launch the app on your mobile device. Since you are using this application for the first time, click the Skip button in the upper right corner.
2. After transferring the interface, click the arrow icon at the upper left corner.
3. If you want to edit an image in your photo gallery, click the OK button to continue.

![blur a part of image on mobile using Yourcam](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-part-of-an-image-13.png)

1. Select the Allow option to allow the app to access your photo gallery.
2. Swipe the screen and choose the photo you would like to blur.
3. Open the Edit tab and navigate to Tools. Next, click on the Blur option.
4. In the Blur effect, select the shape of the outline you want to use when shaping the blur effect. The Ellipse gives you a long oval shape, making it ideal for selfies or full-length images.

![blur a part of image on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-part-of-an-image-14.png)

1. Once you have chosen the shape, you will see the effect in action. Everything within the center of that shape will stay untouched and in sharp focus. Anything beyond the internal shape will subtly start to fade into a blur.
2. To reshape the outer edges' size of the effect, drag the outer shape outline.
3. When you make the outer shape larger, you'll retain more of your image in focus while reducing the harshness of the blur. You can adjust the outer edges and rotate the outline with your two fingers.

The app also has additional effect shapes for more customization options. You can edit the shape of the effect, from heart, star, circle, and more.

### 2\. Use Built-in Photo Edit

You can blur parts of a picture on your Android phone without installing a third-party app. Android mobile devices come with multiple ways to use their in-built app to blur parts of a picture or background. Let's look at how to blur part of an image on your Samsung phone.

1. Use the gallery app to open your image and press the pencil icon.
