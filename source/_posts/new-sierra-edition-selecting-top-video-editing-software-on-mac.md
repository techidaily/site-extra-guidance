### 5\. JahShaka

![jahshaka](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jahshaka-for-mac.jpg)

JahShaka is an open-source video editor that’s in alpha so it does have many crashes. It does have real-time effects and rendering. It’s in full development so for the time being you do need to deal with a lack of features. But it is really cool to use and it does manage to bring in front some interesting options as a whole.
