### Memejacking

Memejacking is using these famous memes as a mode of transportation. Many memes last for weeks, months, or even years, but a brand-new meme is always spreading. Jumping on current trends while they're new and, most crucially, relevant is the key to meme success. Memes that are the result of singular incidents are ideal for this. Everyone shares as many of them as they can when they first appear, but once the meme is finished, it is over.

### "No One" Meme

The "no one" meme is certainly one you've seen flying around the internet. Its purpose is to suggest an unusual or bizarre notion that no one requested in the first place or to draw attention to an oddity that everyone shares but that goes unmentioned, such as turning down the radio in the vehicle while checking up directions.

![no one meme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/no-one-meme.jpg)

### Contrasting Memes

When we use our talents of observation and identify a connection between two things, humor sometimes results. Then we create a side-by-side comparison meme to communicate that realization to the rest of the globe. The audience also values well-written, concise conversation. Be inventive, but stick to the proven strategies you are familiar with.

### 2\. What should be in a meme?

Simply said, a short passage of text with a pertinent picture attached is simpler to comprehend. You want to present your material in a way that will generate that trending moment since you are vying for consumers' attention on social media with millions of other users. In certain social research, it was shown that memes were up to 40 times more likely than other forms of material to be shared on social media.

### 3\. How do I start making memes?

An effective meme approach may take advantage of social media's ability to multiply by becoming viral and connecting with a large local and global audience, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, or even LinkedIn. After creating a meme, remember to follow fundamental marketing concepts and evaluate the reaction. If it is effective, look for the factors that contributed to it and use the same guidelines moving forward.

## Conclusion

Users are growing more and more disinterested in social media because of the abundance of information that is developed with marketing in mind, which is clogging up the space. Memes have emerged as a common means of effectively yet quietly spreading corporate messaging in this dangerous environment. Consider adopting the same idea and, by changing an image or some text, keeping it fresh and shareable for a few more days. One of the benefits of memes is that they can be swiftly updated.
