### Conclusion

So, this article explored the different methods on how to make Instagram videos with music. So far, the sticker method wins out for being user-friendly. But it's not infallible. It works best for a quick video with no fuss.

If you want to create a video with all the bells and whistles, you're better off working with a video editing app like Wondershare Filmora. It's feature-packed and has an easy learning curve. So it would work best for hobbyists and experts.
