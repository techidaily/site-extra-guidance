## 1: How to use Window Media Player to Rip CD?

 **Step 1: Quick Rip Vs Normal Rip:**

 If you are accessing CDs for the very first time then you must be searching hard about how to rip music from a CD. Don‚Äôt worry! The tutorial below can help you to understand this process.

You can also enter your desired bit rate value to ensure right content quality. But note that, better content quality means larger file size.
