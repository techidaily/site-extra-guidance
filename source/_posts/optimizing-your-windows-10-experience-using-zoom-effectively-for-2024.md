## Part 1\. How to Download Zoom Desktop Client

A popular trend, particularly in the last two years, is working from home. Although the Basic plan that is free has a 40-minute time restriction on group meetings, Zoom is accessible for download for free. However, you are permitted to hold an infinite number of one-on-one meetings and group meetings with up to 100 participants. If you want more, you may upgrade to the Pro plan, which raises the 24-hour meeting time limit and adds admin controls and features like a personalized meeting ID and user management.
