 Manfrotto have designed this mini tripod with portable and lightweight configuration and it can handle wide range of video shooting devices like basic DSLR cameras, iPhones, Bridge cameras and even the Compact System Cameras (CSC).

 Most of the professionals love to use Pixi Mini with CSCs because it ensures highest stability with its rich design. The maximum weight of this tripod goes up to 0.23 Kg and you will love its stainless steel body that makes it impressive enough.

 Pixi handles all connections with its standard 1/4” screw attachment that is available right above a rubber circle.

 The rubberized pads ensure perfect grip and plastic legs offer maximum length adjustment at 13.5cm. A small push button type mechanism maintains easy alignments at various positions as Pixi can rotate your camera up to 360 degrees and maintains tilt up to 35 degree.

 You can buy Pixi with payment of £25 only but the downside is that it offers limited handling abilities with lesser control over ball tightness. However, the sleek and lightweight design have an edge with pocket friendly construction.

## Full-Size Camera Tripods

 So, here we are going to talk about the full size tripods. Professionals often use them to handle their classy DSLR cameras and they can also hold almost all latest digital camera models including your iPhone.

 If you have planned your shoot at some windy location then these full sized tripods can ensure you trouble free results with their super steady performance. No matter whether you have connected a large camera or an iPhone on these tripods, they will always ensure perfect stability.

 Note that, this type of tripods need a tripod mount for making connection with iPhones you need to make some additional investment to buy one. Once you get a good quality mount then it can be easily used to make connection with iPhone via screw thread.

 Market is loaded with so many full size camera tripod designs, you can pick any one out of Joby series, Shoulder mount or collections offered by Glif as all of them can be used with iPhones and standard tripods.

 Here is one drawback of full sized tripod design; it is quite heavier so you cannot carry it on your tours, especially not when you are going for adventurous trips to enjoy hiking or trekking etc.

## Why need a Tripod for Smartphone?

 You will need assistance from a tripod in almost all professional level shooting conditions because here we cannot make compromise for quality. A tripod ensures blur free videos that are often generated with camera shakes.

 iPhones are commonly used with low shutter speed, especially in low light conditions but this type of recording arrangement naturally give rise to camera shakes whenever the device is moved slightly. To ensure a good quality video you may have to make efforts for proper light arrangements at shooting site but this is not always possible in practical environment. So, the best solution is to buy a tripod that can eliminate all harmful effects generated due to camera shakes. It ensures crisp and sharp details for every shot.

 If you are planning to capture deep details from nature like rivers and waterfalls etc then tripod can assist you to avail impressive results. They are also helpful to improve details with time lapse photography.
