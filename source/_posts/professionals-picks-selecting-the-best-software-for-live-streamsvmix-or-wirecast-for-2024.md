## Conclusion

 In terms of functionality, both vMix and Wirecast possess a set of common features. However, there are some exceptions with both these platforms in terms of configuration, pricing, system requirements etc. Both of them are good but your choices will largely depend on the convenience with the software settings, budget, computer devices and other factors. It is advisable to go for a free trial test to check your convenience with both the software before subscribing to any paid packages.
