You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories. There are 10 levels in this game and you will have to fight with the gravity as well since this will pull you down the holes. So, be very careful!

 This is a complete non-violent game, requires BT controller or touchpad to play. Indago is the developer of this game and it has been released on 17th of August.

## [Dark Days](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1063691710368492/  )

 The response is extremely positive and the game has already become quite famous among the VR users.

## [Motivator](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1012545955507257/  )

 This is another very exciting shooting game plotted in the year 2044\. During this time people tend to lose their spirit because of an unknown virus attack named lethargy. The virus soon goes out of control and in such a situation the International Disease Research Center creates a nanomachine that can attack the virus at its source.

 The name of the machine is Motivator that can restore the spirit in the mankind. The success of the mission solely depends on the piloting skill of yours. This is an action game and is already gaining popularity. Blue Print Inc. is the developer of this game. A truly skilled pilot is very much in demand. If you think you have that ability, then save the mankind with your skills.
