## Part 1\. What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?

Various types of music can be used for podcast intros, including creative common music, royalty-free music, and public domain music. So, whether you're looking to use vocals or special music as an intro for your podcast show, it's crucial you understand these different types of music, as it'll save you from violating copyright laws that could compromise your podcast show's reputation online.

**Creative Common Music (Free to use)**

Creative Common Music is music tracks where the artist gives users 100% freedom to use it without permission. It's a type of music with no copyright. But you might be required to provide credit to the artist. So please read the terms and conditions attached to any creative common music before using it.

**Royalty-Free Music (Paid)**

Royalty-Free Music is the opposite of Creative Common Music. To use such music, you need to have a subscription on the website or make a one-time payment to have 100% right to use it in your podcast intro. In addition, such music is usually subjected to copyright. So, using it without permission will risk your podcast show's reputation.

**Public Domain Music (Free to use)**

Public Domain Music is music with an expired copyright license published in a public domain where you can use them for free without permission or giving credit. For example, in the United States, music works published in 1926 or earlier are Public Domain Music.

### 1\. [YouTube Audio Library](https://www.audiolibrary.com.co/)

![places to find music for podcast intro youtube audio library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-1.jpg)

Many users are unaware that YouTube also has one of the biggest collections of royalty-free music that you can download and use for creative or artistic purposes. YouTube Audio Library allows you to search for royalty-free music by mood, track name, artist, or genre. So, regardless of the topic or theme of your podcast, you will find something suitable in its vast library.

Plus, you do not need any registrations or have to answer long questionnaires to access royalty-free music for podcast intros from the YouTube library. Instead, you can use the existing YouTube account to search, download, and use the music available on the platform.

**Pros and Cons of YouTube Audio Library**

* You can listen to the music on YouTube Audio Library or YouTube, SoundCloud, Apple Music, or Spotify.
* You do not have to open an account or sign up.
* YouTube Audio Library has one of the biggest collections of royalty-free music.

### 2\. [Dig CCmixter –Free](http://dig.ccmixter.org/)

![places to find music for podcast intro dig ccmixter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-2.jpg)

Another free platform, Dig CCmixter, is a community-supported platform that accepts music from musicians and allows users to download them for free. You do not have to tag the musician who created and uploaded the track to the Dig CCmixter library. An open internet utility, Dig CCmixter, does not even ask you to register on the site.

You can use tags to look for specific music genres and get a short list of types of music you need for your podcast. However, the Dig CCmixter site is unsecured; it isn't a big concern, but most browsers (depending on your Settings) won't allow you to access the site.

Still, if you can access the Dig CCmixter site, you will have one of the largest collections of royalty-free music that you can use to create podcast intros and outros.

**Pros and Cons of Dig CCmixter:**

 Pros

* You can use music for free as long as you give credit.
* Broad music collection.

 Cons

* The search functionality could be better.
* The website's interface looks outdated.

* **Trustpilot:** 3/ 5 (726K user reviews)
* **TrustRadius**: 4.7/ 5 (400K+ user reviews)

**User Review**: "YouTube Audio Library has always satisfied all my music needs. The best thing: you do not need to pay even a dime to use professional-sounding music."

### 3\. [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/home) – Free

You can find a piece of suitable music for podcast intros that will intrigue your users, from rock, jazz, reggae, or electronic. Another essential thing about Free Music Archive is that it gives you access to premium music service providers.

So in case you have the budget in the future, you can even access premium sites and find sophisticated tunes for your podcast created by professionals without having to find such places. Its interface is simple, and even technophobes can navigate the site seamlessly.

**Pros and Cons of Free Music Archive**

* Free Music Archive allows you to search for music using tags, top downloads, artists, genres, featured mixes, and more.
* Instrumental, Rock, Soul-RnB, Pop, Electronic, Classical, Hip-hop, Folk, Jazz, Country, and more genres.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![places to find music for podcast intro stockmusic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-4.jpg)

StochMusic has a simple concept, and it sells you music royalty in exchange for a subscription. For as little as US$ 16.69/mo, you can download as many soundtracks as you want for podcast intros. There is another subscription plan which also gives you access to unlimited sound effects besides soundtracks. Soundtracks are suitable for podcast creators looking to add podcast intros.

At the same time, the second plan will be helpful to creators that create story-based podcasts where sound effects add drama to voice and intrigue your users. StockMusic charges money for the music and sound effects because, unlike YouTube Audio Library and Free Music Archive, StockMusic includes music only from professionals. So, the music you get in return for your money is subpar and sounds professional.

**Pros and Cons of StockMusic**

 Pros

* Filter by genre, mood, instruments, duration, and more to search for soundtracks and audio effects.
* Get a license for the music that you purchase on StockMusic and monetize. You can also sell the music to other parties. Transfer the license to someone else via the platform.
* Clean and simple user interface. The site is mobile-responsive, which works well even on mobile devices.

 Cons

* Before downloading music from the site, you must register and subscribe to a plan.

**Ratings and User Reviews of Free Music Archive for Android:**

* **G2 Rating: 3.6/5 (400 user reviews)**
* **User Review: "**Free Music Archive makes life easier by giving me access to different types of music I need for my content."

## Summing up

The main aim of this guide was to inform you about the sites that have royalty-free music for podcast intros so that you can use music in your podcast intros without legal problems.

The problem is that many podcast creators are unaware that they cannot use copyrighted music. And this often results in a ban on the podcast or huge fines.

However, you now have all the information regarding how and where to use music for podcast intros. Always use only non-copyrighted music so you do not face such problems.

Part 1\. What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?

Various types of music can be used for podcast intros, including creative common music, royalty-free music, and public domain music. So, whether you're looking to use vocals or special music as an intro for your podcast show, it's crucial you understand these different types of music, as it'll save you from violating copyright laws that could compromise your podcast show's reputation online.

**Creative Common Music (Free to use)**

Creative Common Music is music tracks where the artist gives users 100% freedom to use it without permission. It's a type of music with no copyright. But you might be required to provide credit to the artist. So please read the terms and conditions attached to any creative common music before using it.

**Royalty-Free Music (Paid)**

Royalty-Free Music is the opposite of Creative Common Music. To use such music, you need to have a subscription on the website or make a one-time payment to have 100% right to use it in your podcast intro. In addition, such music is usually subjected to copyright. So, using it without permission will risk your podcast show's reputation.

**Public Domain Music (Free to use)**

Public Domain Music is music with an expired copyright license published in a public domain where you can use them for free without permission or giving credit. For example, in the United States, music works published in 1926 or earlier are Public Domain Music.

## Part 2\. 10 Places To Get Music for Your Podcast Intros

A professional-sounding podcast starts with intro music and uses songs to move the story forward. Now you have a brief understanding of the kind of music you can use for a podcast intro, let's dive into the list of the top 10 places to get music for your podcast intro.

![places to find music for podcast intro stockmusic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-4.jpg)

StochMusic has a simple concept, and it sells you music royalty in exchange for a subscription. For as little as US$ 16.69/mo, you can download as many soundtracks as you want for podcast intros.

 Pros

* Filter by genre, mood, instruments, duration, and more to search for soundtracks and audio effects.
* Get a license for the music that you purchase on StockMusic and monetize. You can also sell the music to other parties. Transfer the license to someone else via the platform.
* Clean and simple user interface. The site is mobile-responsive, which works well even on mobile devices.

 Cons

* Before downloading music from the site, you must register and subscribe to a plan.
