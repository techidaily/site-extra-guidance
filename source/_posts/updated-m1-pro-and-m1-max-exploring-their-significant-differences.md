So, to get a broad view of Apple M1 Pro vs. Max, a detailed comparison table will assist you in comparing the Apple M1 pro specs with that of M1 Max.

| |  **Apple M1 Pro**  | **Apple M1 Max**                 |                                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**              | 10-core                          | 10-core                                             |
| **GPU**              | 16-core                          | 24 or 32-core                                       |
| **Battery Life**     | 16 hours                         | 17-21 hours                                         |
| **Memory**           | 32 GB                            | 32 GB (Extendable to 64 GB)                         |
| **Transistors**      | 33.7 billion                     | 57 billion                                          |
| **Memory Bandwidth** | 200 GB/s                         | 400 GB/s                                            |
| **Performance**      | CPU is 70 percent better than M1 | Advanced video editing, powerful graphic processing |

In terms of CPU performance, battery life, and technology design, there is not much difference between M1 Pro and Intel chips. Though in other areas, there seems to be a particular performance variance. It must say that both of the processors work well in their area.

As a user, you can go with any one of them as per your choice and need. As, both M1 Pro and Intel chips look good in terms of specification and performance.
