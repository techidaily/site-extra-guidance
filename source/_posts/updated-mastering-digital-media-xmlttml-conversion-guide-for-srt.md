## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.

The last subtitle format we’ll be converting into SRT is the VOB format. Let’s see how to do it.

## How to Convert VOB to SRT

The best bet for converting a VOB subtitle to SRT is with SONIX.

Step1 First of all, [sign up for the SONIX](https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign%5Fup) for getting free 30 min transcription(charges will be applied after that.)

## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.
