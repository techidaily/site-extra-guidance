### · Enhance Personal Space

For professional video conferences, you need to be more presentable and active. You don't have to do much to achieve what you want with Zoom Meetings. Turn on the 'Touch up Appearance.' Focus on the lighting where you are going to sit. Lastly, make sure you raise the computer to your eye level. This makes you look active and confident.

### · React with Emoji

Another tip for using Zoom Meetings like a pro is its emoji feature. With Zoom Meetings, a video conferencing tool, you can react with emojis on your screen. Even if you are muted, the emojis will speak for you on the screen.
