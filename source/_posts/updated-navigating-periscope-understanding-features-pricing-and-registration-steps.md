* Periscope also gives the users a facility of map feature with the help of which they can discover the videos being shared across the globe. The interactive map view will let the viewers search the location and discover various videos being streamed at different places.
  
* Another amazing feature of Periscope is its replay feature. This feature helps in video broadcast getting saved automatically and which can be replayed up to 24 hours following the first broadcast.
  
* You can also download your live stream and get it saved to you after finishing your broadcast. This will help you keeping the record of your video so that you can watch it even after it gets expired.
  
* The app, after being purchased by Twitter has got full Twitter integration. In other words, if you have Twitter account and followers, Periscope will simply connect those followers and will inform them regarding your new Periscope broadcast.
