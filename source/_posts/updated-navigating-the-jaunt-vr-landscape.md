Jaunt primarily collaborated with Paul McCartney in 2014, who is part of The Beatles. Together, they built a 360-degree complete immersive concert experience, giving users a VR head mounted device.

 Later, Jaunt worked with The Northface and introduced a project popularly known as “The Northface VR”.

Earlier in 2015, you have witnessed how aggressive Jaunt VR was to offer the best possible virtual reality experience.

The project took place in the Moab (Utah) and Yosemite National Park (California), which featured athletes Same Elias and Cedar Wright.

 Remember the concert of Big Sean happened at Highland Center of Hollywood? His track “Blessing” was improved by the VR technology of Jaunt. This enabled viewers to experience like they were really in the front row of the audience.
