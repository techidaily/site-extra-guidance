## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.

## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.

![subRip subtitle file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-19.jpg)

### 2\. SSA

It is a plain text file that is composed of three sections, Script Info, Styles, and Events.

![xml subtitle file appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-3.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. XML

This subtitle format contains encoding, duration, and content of subtitles like this,

### 4\. TTML

This is an XML-based format that has a somewhat complicated look with <> appearing in many places.

![convert ttml to srt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-11.jpg)

### 5\. STL

This format of subtitles lacks a timing section like in SRT.

![stl subtitle file appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-5.jpg)

### 6\. VOB

It’s a container for audio, video, or subtitles that looks like this.
