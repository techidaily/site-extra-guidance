## Do You Really Need an HDMI 2.1 Monitor?

To be frank, talking about the monitor itself, few companies and factories are making these monitors at the moment, but a rising trend can be seen without a doubt. So at the start point of this new HDMI tech, we can say that it is still far from the market's mainstream. Prices are high; choices are limited.  

On the other hand, talking about games, say you're buying this for your next-gen gaming console, consider now most games are 4K 60hz or 1080p 120hz. It is still far from what Sony and Microsoft promise.  

But if you're not a price-sensitive consumer or you are a geek, here is our choice of the top 6 HDMI 2.1 monitors you can find in 2024.

## Top 6 Best HDMI 2.1 Monitors
