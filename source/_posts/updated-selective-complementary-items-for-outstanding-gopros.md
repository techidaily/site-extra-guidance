#### 12.GoPro Quick Key

In case if you need a system to easily transfer your footage from GoPro camera to tablet or microphone then Quick Key will do this task easily. These accessories usually come in form of USB-C or Micro USB and sometimes in lighting variants. Simply insert your GoPro MicroSD card from one end and insert the other terminal on your device; it will easily begin the file transfer process. It can be easily connected to a key chain for easy access but you need to pay more to buy this accessory. It costs somewhere around $20 and also offers WiFi connectivity for direct connection so that Footage can be transferred anytime.
