The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

Here are more differences between 3D and 1D LUTs:

##### 3D LUT

It Places luma and color in a 3D (Cube) form; hence very easy to work with.

The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

The color and luma are placed in a 1D; hence quite not easy to work on.

It contains a clear value of the outputs and on the basis of the bit depth, i.e., 1024 values in a 10 - bit.

It is a walk in the park when it comes to adjustments to the basic settings such as contrast, brightness, and white balance. But, the resulting output will be mid.

Wrapping up the differences, 3D LUTs are essential for colorists and editors since they can carry out tons of color customizations. Therefore, they can make their work uniquely stunning.

## How to Import 3D LUT to Photoshop

There are some 3D LUTs that Adobe Photoshop provides. Usually, these LUTs are limited and are not very effective when working on major projects. Most people, therefore, prefer to add their own 3D LUTs to Photoshop.

There are two ways to import 3D LUT to Photoshop; Adding LUTs to a specific project and Installing LUTs.

Before applying any of the two methods, you need to ensure you have your LUTs right there. You can purchase them or get them for free. Download them to your computer device.

#### Method 1\. Adding LUTs to a Particular Project

This first step is undemanding since you only have to locate a given LUT and then directly incorporate it into your project.

### Step 1\. Unzip your LUTs

First, you ought to unzip your files. In Mac devices, you double-click on the file to unzip it, whereas, in Windows, you right-click then select “Extract all” from the drop-down list.
