##### Step2 Perform Professional Video Editing

To modify a video, right-click it and choose edit from the menu. The video may then be rotated by selecting the appropriate effects button. Depending on your needs, you may also rotate 90 degrees in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, flip level, or go vertical. In that case, then. A number of visual effects may also be added, and the best thing is that you can utilize others from the standard library as well, giving you more flexibility in where you place them.
